<h1>BASEBALL JOE IN THE CENTRAL
LEAGUE</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>DANGER</small></h2>


<p>“Why, here’s Joe!”</p>

<p>“So soon? I didn’t expect him until night.”</p>

<p>The girl who had uttered the first exclamation,
and her mother whose surprise was manifested in
the second, hurried to the door of the cottage, up
the gravel walk to which a tall, athletic youth was
then striding, swinging a heavy valise as though
he enjoyed the weight of it.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mother!” he called gaily. “How are
you, Sis?” and a moment later Joe Matson was
alternating his marks of affection between his
mother and sister.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good to be home again!” he went
on, looking into the two faces which showed the
pleasure felt in the presence of the lad. “Mighty
good to be home again!”</p>

<p>“And we’re glad to have him; aren’t we,
Mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Clara, of course,” and Mrs. Matson
spoke with a hesitation that her son could not help
noticing. “Of course we just love to have you
home Joe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There, now, Mother, I know what you’re going
to say!” he interrupted with good-natured
raillery. “You rather wish I’d stuck on there at
Yale, turning into a fossil, or something like that,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe! Of course I didn’t want you to turn
into a fossil,” objected his mother, in shocked
tones. “But I did hope that you might&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Become a sky-pilot! Is that it, Momsey?”
and he put his arm about her slender waist.</p>

<p>“Joe Matson! What a way to talk about a
minister!” she cried. “The idea!”</p>

<p>“Well, Mother, I meant no disrespect. A sky-pilot
is an ancient and honorable calling, but not
for me. So here I am. Yale will have to worry
along without yours truly, and I guess she’ll make
out fairly well. But how is everything? Seen
any of the fellows lately? How’s father? How’s
the business?”</p>

<p>The last two questions seemed to open a painful
subject, for mother and daughter looked at one
another as though each one was saying:</p>

<p>“You tell him!”</p>

<p>Joe Matson sensed that something disagreeable
was in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded, turning from his
mother to his sister. “What has happened?”
It was not Joe’s way to shrink from danger, or
from a disagreeable duty. And part of his success
as a baseball pitcher was due to this very fact.</p>

<p>Now he was aware that something had gone
amiss since his last visit home, and he wanted to
know what it was. He put his arms on his
mother’s shoulders&mdash;frail little shoulders they
were, too&mdash;yet they had borne many heavy burdens
of which Joe knew nothing. What mother’s
shoulders have not?</p>

<p>The lad looked into her eyes&mdash;eyes that held a
hint of pain. His own were clear and bright&mdash;they
snapped with life and youthful vigor.</p>

<p>“What is it, Momsey?” he asked softly. “Don’t
be afraid to tell me. Has anything happened to
dad?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it isn’t anything like that, Joe,” said
Clara quickly. “We didn’t write to you about it
for fear you’d worry and lose that last big game
with Princeton. It’s only that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your father has lost some money!” interrupted
Mrs. Matson, wishing to have the disagreeable
truth out at once.</p>

<p>“Oh, if that’s all, we can soon fix that!” cried
Joe, gaily, as though it was the easiest thing in
the world. “Just wait until I begin drawing my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
salary as pitcher for the Pittston team in the Central
League, and then you’ll be on Easy Street.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it’s a great deal of money, Joe!”
spoke Clara in rather awed tones.</p>

<p>“Well, you haven’t heard what my salary is to
be.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t make it so serious, Clara,” interposed
Mrs. Matson. “Your father hasn’t exactly
lost the money, Joe. But he has made a number
of investments that seem likely to turn out badly,
and there’s a chance that he’ll have to lose, just
as some others will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if there’s a chance, what’s the use of
worrying until you have to?” asked Joe, boy-like.</p>

<p>“The chances are pretty good&mdash;or, rather,
pretty bad&mdash;that the money will go,” said Mrs.
Matson with a sigh. “Oh, dear! Isn’t it too
bad, after all his hard work!”</p>

<p>“There, there, Mother!” exclaimed the lad,
soothingly. “Let’s talk about something pleasant.
I’ll go down to the works soon, and see dad. Just
now I’m as hungry as a&mdash;well, as a ball player
after he’s won out in the world’s series. Got anything
to eat in the house?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” exclaimed Clara, with a laugh,
“though whether it will suit your high and mightiness,
after what you have been used to at college,
I can’t say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not fussy, Sis! Trot out a broiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
lobster or two, half a roast chicken, some oysters,
a little salad and a cup of coffee and I’ll try and
make that do until the regular meal is ready!”</p>

<p>They laughed at his infectious good-humor, and
a look of relief showed on Mrs. Matson’s face.
But it did not altogether remove the shadow of
concern that had been there since Joe wrote of
his decision to leave Yale to take up the life of a
professional baseball player. It had been a sore
blow to his mother, who had hopes of seeing him
enter the ministry, or at least one of the professions.
And with all his light-heartedness, Joe
realized the shattered hopes. But, for the life of
him, he could not keep on at college&mdash;a place entirely
unsuited to him. But of that more later.</p>

<p>Seated at the dining-room table, the three were
soon deep in a rather disjointed conversation.
Joe’s sister and mother waited on him as only a
mother and sister can serve a returned son and
brother.</p>

<p>Between bites, as it were, Joe asked all sorts of
questions, chiefly about his father’s business
troubles. Neither Mrs. Matson nor her daughter
could give a very clear account of what had happened,
or was in danger of happening, and the
young pitcher, whose recent victory in the college
championship games had made him quite famous,
remarked:</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go down and see dad myself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
give him the benefit of my advice. I suppose he’s
at the Harvester Works?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mrs. Matson. “He is there
early and late. He is working on another patent,
and he says if it’s successful he won’t mind about
the bad investments. But he hasn’t had much
luck, so far.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to take him out to a ball game, and
get the cobwebs out of his head,” said Joe, with
a laugh. “It’s a bad thing to get in a rut. Just
a little more bread, Sis.”</p>

<p>“And so you have really left Yale?” asked his
mother, almost hoping something might have occurred
to change her son’s mind. “You are not
going back, Joe?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve quit, Mother, sold off what belongings
I didn’t want to keep, and here I am.”</p>

<p>“And when are you going to begin pitching for
that professional team?” asked Clara, coming in
with the bread.</p>

<p>“I can’t exactly say. I’ve got to go meet Mr.
Gregory, the manager and the largest stockholder
in the club. So far I’ve only dealt with Mr. James
Mack, his assistant and scout. He picked me up
and made a contract with me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it won’t go through,” ventured Mrs.
Matson, half-hopefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it will,” answered Joe, easily.
“Anyhow, I’ve got an advance payment, and I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hold them to their terms. I expect I’ll be sent
South to the training camp, where the rest of the
players are. The season opens soon, and then
we’ll be traveling all over the circuit&mdash;mostly in
the Middle West.”</p>

<p>“Then we won’t see much of you, Joe,” and his
sister spoke regretfully.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to be pretty much on the jump,
Sis. But I’ll get home whenever I can. And if
ever you get near where the Pittston club is playing&mdash;that’s
my team, you know&mdash;” and Joe pretended
to swell up with pride&mdash;“why, just take a
run in, and I’ll get you box seats.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t care much for baseball,”
sighed Mrs. Matson.</p>

<p>“I do!” cried Clara with enthusiasm. “Oh,
we’ve had some dandy games here this Spring,
Joe, though the best games are yet to come. The
Silver Stars are doing fine!”</p>

<p>“Are they really?” Joe asked. “And since
they lost my invaluable services as a twirler? How
thoughtless of them, Sis!”</p>

<p>Clara laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, they miss you a lot,” she pouted, “and
often speak of you. Maybe, if you’re going to be
home a few days, you could pitch a game for
them.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare do it, Clara.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not, I’d like to know,” and her eyes
showed her surprise.</p>

<p>“Because I’m a professional now, and I can’t
play in amateur contests&mdash;that is, it wouldn’t be
regular.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess no one here would mind, Joe.
Will you have some of these canned peaches?”</p>

<p>“Just a nibble, Sis&mdash;just a nibble. I’ve made
out pretty well. You can make as good bread as
ever, Momsey!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you like it, Joe. Your father thinks
there’s nothing like home-made bread.”</p>

<p>“That’s where dad shows his good judgment.
Quite discriminating on dad’s part, I’m sure. Yes,
indeed!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, you’re so&mdash;so different!” said Clara,
looking at her brother sharply.</p>

<p>“In what way, Sis?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” she said, slowly. “I suppose
it’s&mdash;the college influence.”</p>

<p>“Well, a fellow can’t live at Yale, even for a
short time, without absorbing something different
from the usual life. It’s an education in itself
just to go there if you never opened a book. It’s
a different world.”</p>

<p>“And I wish you had stayed there!” burst out
Mrs. Matson, with sudden energy. “Oh, I don’t
like you to be a professional ball player! It’s no
profession at all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, call it a business then, if you like,” said
Joe good-naturedly. “Say it isn’t a profession,
though it is called one. As a business proposition,
Mother, it’s one of the biggest in the world to-day.
The players make more money than lots of
professional men, and they don’t have to work
half so hard&mdash;not that I mind that.”</p>

<p>“Joe Matson! Do you mean to tell me a ball
player&mdash;even one who tosses the ball for the other
man to hit at&mdash;does he make more than&mdash;than a
<em>minister</em>?” demanded his mother.</p>

<p>“I should say so, Mother! Why, there are
very few ministers who make as much as even an
ordinary player in a minor league. And as for
the major leaguers&mdash;why, they could equal half a
dozen preachers. Mind, I’m not talking against
the ministry, or any of the learned professions.
I only wish I had the brains and ability to enter
one.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t, and there’s no use pretending I
have. And, though I do say it myself, there’s no
use spoiling a good pitcher to make a poor minister.
I’m sorry, Mother, that I couldn’t keep on
at Yale&mdash;sorry on your account, not on mine. But
I just couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“How&mdash;how much do you suppose you’ll get a
year for pitching in this Central League?” asked
Mrs. Matson, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re going to start me on fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hundred dollars a year,” said Joe rather proudly,
“and of course I can work up from that.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred dollars!” cried Mrs. Matson.
“Why, that’s more than a hundred dollars a
month!”</p>

<p>“A good deal more, when you figure that I
don’t have to do anything in the Winter months,
Mother.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred dollars!” murmured Clara.
“Why, that’s more than father earned when he
got married, Mother. I’ve heard you say so&mdash;lots
of times.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Clara. But then fifteen hundred dollars
went further in those days than it does now. But,
Joe, I didn’t think you’d get so much as that.”</p>

<p>“There’s my contract, Mother,” and he pulled
it from his pocket with a flourish.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, Joe&mdash;Oh! I <em>did</em> want you to
be a minister, or a lawyer, or a doctor; but since
you feel you can’t&mdash;well, perhaps it’s all for the
best, Joe,” and she sighed softly. “Maybe it’s
for the best.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see that it will be, Mother. And now
I’m going down street and see some of the boys.
I suppose Tom Davis is around somewhere. Then
I’ll stroll in on dad. I want to have a talk with
him.”</p>

<p>“Shall I unpack your valise?” asked Clara.</p>

<p>“Yes. I guess I’ll be home for a few days before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
starting in at the training camp. I’ll be back
to supper, anyhow,” and, with a laugh he went
out and down the main street of Riverside, where
the Matsons made their home.</p>

<p>As Baseball Joe walked along the thoroughfare
he was greeted by many acquaintances&mdash;old
and young. They were all glad to see him, for the
fame of the pitcher who had won the victory for
Yale was shared, in a measure, by his home town.
In the case of baseball players, at least, they are
not “prophets without honor save in their own
country.”</p>

<p>Joe inquired for his old chum, Tom Davis, but
no one seemed to have noticed him that day, and,
making up his mind he would locate him later, the
young pitcher turned his footsteps in the direction
of the Royal Harvester Works, where his father
was employed. To reach the plant Joe had to
cross the railroad, and in doing this he noticed a
man staggering along the tracks.</p>

<p>The man was not a prepossessing specimen.
His clothes were ragged and dirty&mdash;in short
“tramp” was written all over him.</p>

<p>“And he acts as though he were drugged, or
had taken too much whiskey,” said Joe. “Too
bad! Maybe he’s had a lot of trouble. You can’t
always tell.</p>

<p>“But I’m sure of one thing, and that is he’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
better get off the track. He doesn’t seem able to
take care of himself.</p>

<p>“Look out there!” cried the young pitcher,
with sudden energy. “Look out for that freight,
old man! You’re walking right into danger!”</p>

<p>A train of freight cars was backing down the
rails, right upon the man who was staggering
along, unheeding.</p>

<p>The engineer blew his whistle shrilly&mdash;insistently;
but still the ragged man did not get off the
track.</p>

<p>Joe sprinted at his best pace, and in an instant
had grasped the man by the arm. The tramp
looked up with bleary, blood-shot eyes&mdash;uncomprehending&mdash;almost
unseeing.</p>

<p>“Wha&mdash;wha’s matter?” he asked, thickly.</p>

<p>“Matter&mdash;matter enough when you get sense
enough to realize it!” said Joe sharply, as he
pulled him to one side, and only just in time, for
a second later the freight train thundered past at
hardly slackened speed in spite of the fact that the
brakes had been clapped on.</p>

<p>The man staggered at Joe’s sudden energy, and
would have toppled over against a switch had not
the young pitcher held him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR THE SOUTH</small></h2>


<p>Sweeping past, in the cab of the locomotive,
the engineer leaned out and shook his fist at the
tramp.</p>

<p>“You ought to be locked up!” he yelled, with
savage energy. Then, lest he might not seem to
appreciate Joe’s action in saving the man’s life
and preventing a lot of trouble for the railroad
authorities, the engineer added:</p>

<p>“Much obliged to you, young fellow. You
saved us a bad mess. Better turn that hobo over
to one of the yard detectives. He’ll take care of
him, all right.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll get him off the tracks and start him
home, if I can,” answered Joe, but it is doubtful
if the engineer heard.</p>

<p>“You had a close call, old man,” went on Joe,
as he helped the tramp to stand upright. “Better
get off the railroad. Where do you want to go?”</p>

<p>“Hey?”</p>

<p>“I ask you where you want to go. I’ll give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
you a hand, if it isn’t too far. It’s dangerous here&mdash;for
a man in your&mdash;condition.”</p>

<p>“Uh! Don’t make no difference where I go,
I reckon,” replied the man, thickly. “No difference
at all. I’m down and out, an’ one place’s
good’s nuther. Down&mdash;an’&mdash;out!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe you can come back,” said
Joe, as cheerfully as he could. “Don’t give up.”</p>

<p>“Come back! Huh! Guess you don’t know the
game. Fellers like me never come back. Say, bo,
you’ve got quite an arm on you,” he said admiringly,
as he noted the ease with which the young
pitcher helped him over the tracks. The unfortunate
man could hardly help himself. “You’ve
got an arm&mdash;all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much. Just from pitching. I expect.”</p>

<p>“Pitching!” The man straightened up as
though a lash had struck him. “Pitching, did you
say? In&mdash;er&mdash;in what league?”</p>

<p>“Not in any league yet, though I’ve signed with
the Central.”</p>

<p>“The Central? Huh! A bush league.”</p>

<p>“I left the Yale ’varsity to go with them,” said
Joe, a little nettled at the tone of the man whose
life he had just saved.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;you pitched for Yale?” There was
more deference shown now.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we beat Princeton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“You did? An’ you pitched? Say, young feller,
put her there! Put her&mdash;there!” The man
held out an unsteady hand, which Joe, more to
quiet him than for any other reason, clasped
firmly.</p>

<p>“An’ you beat Princeton! Good for you! Put
her there! I&mdash;er&mdash;I read about that. I can read&mdash;I
got a good education. But I&mdash;er&mdash;Oh, I’m a
fool, that’s what I am. A fool! An’ to think
that I once&mdash;Oh, what’s the use&mdash;what’s the
use?”</p>

<p>The energy faded away from his voice, and he
ended in a half sob. With bowed head he allowed
Joe to lead him across the tracks. A number of
railroad men who had seen the rescue looked at
the pair, but once the tramp was off the line, and
out of immediate danger, they lost interest.</p>

<p>“Can I help you&mdash;do you want to go anywhere
in particular?” asked Joe, kindly.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of goin’ anywhere in particular?”
was the demand. “I’ve got nowhere to go.
One place is as good as another when you’re down&mdash;and
out. Out! Ha! Yes, out! He’s out&mdash;out
at first&mdash;last&mdash;out all the time! Out!”</p>

<p>“Oh, quit!” exclaimed Joe, sharply, for the
man was fast losing his nerve, and was almost
sobbing.</p>

<p>“That’s right, young feller&mdash;that’s right!”
came the quick retort. “I do need pullin’ up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Much obliged to you. I&mdash;I guess I can take care
of myself now.”</p>

<p>“Have you any&mdash;do you need any&mdash;money?”
hesitated Joe.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, thank you. I’ve got some. Not
much, but enough until I can get&mdash;straightened
out. I’m much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>He walked straighter now, and more upright.</p>

<p>“Be careful to keep off the tracks,” warned Joe.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I will. Don’t worry. Much obliged,”
and the man walked off into the woods that adjoined
the railroad.</p>

<p>“Poor old chap,” mused the young pitcher, as
he resumed his way to his father’s shop. And
while I have just a few moments I will take advantage
of them to make my new readers better
acquainted with Joe, and his achievements, as detailed
in the former books of this series.</p>

<p>The first volume is entitled “Baseball Joe of the
Silver Stars,” and tells how Joe began his career
as a pitcher. The Silver Stars were made up of
ball-loving lads in Riverside, a New England town
where Joe lived with his parents and his sister
Clara. Mr. Matson was an inventor of farming
machinery, and had perfected a device that
brought him in substantial returns.</p>

<p>Joe, Tom Davis, and a number of other lads
formed a team that was to represent Riverside.
Their bitterest rivals were the Resolutes of Rocky Ford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a neighboring town, and many hot battles
of the diamond were fought. Joe rapidly developed
as a pitcher, and it was due to his efforts that
his team made such an excellent showing.</p>

<p>In the second book, entitled, “Baseball Joe on
the School Nine,” I related what happened when
our hero went to Excelsior Hall, a boarding institution
just outside of Cedarhurst.</p>

<p>Joe did not find it so easy, there, to make a
showing as a pitcher. There was more competition
to begin with, and he had rivals and enemies.
But he did not give up, and, in spite of many difficulties,
he finally occupied the mound when the
annual struggle for the Blue Banner took place.
And what a game that was!</p>

<p>Joe spent several terms at Excelsior Hall, and
then, more in deference to his mother’s wishes
than because he wanted to, he went to Yale.</p>

<p>For an account of what happened there I refer
my readers to the third book of the series, called
“Baseball Joe at Yale.” Joe had an uphill climb
at the big university. Mingled with the hard
work, the hopes deferred and the jealousies, were,
however, good times a-plenty. That is one reason
why Joe did not want to leave it. But he had an
ambition to become a professional ball player, and
he felt that he was not fitted for a college life.</p>

<p>So when “Jimmie” Mack, assistant manager of
the Pittston team of the Central League, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
out “scouting” for new and promising players,
saw Joe’s pitching battle against Princeton, he
made the young collegian an offer which Joe did
not feel like refusing.</p>

<p>He closed his college career abruptly, and when
this story opens we find him coming back from
New Haven to Riverside. In a day or so he
expected to join the recruits at the training camp
of the Pittston nine, which was at Montville,
North Carolina.</p>

<p>As Joe kept on, after his rescue of the tramp,
his thoughts were busy over many subjects. Chief
among them was wonder as to how he would succeed
in his new career.</p>

<p>“And then I’ve got to learn how dad’s affairs
are,” mused Joe. “I may have to pitch in and
help him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Matson came from his private office in the
Harvester Works, and greeted Joe warmly.</p>

<p>“We didn’t expect you home quite so soon,”
he said, as he clasped his son’s hand.</p>

<p>“No, I found out, after I wrote, that I was
coming home, that I could get an earlier train that
would save me nearly a day, so I took it. But,
Dad, what’s this I hear about your financial
troubles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind about them, Joe,” was the
evasive answer.</p>

<p>“But I want to mind, Dad. I want to help you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Matson went into details, with which I
will not tire the reader. Sufficient to say that the
inventor had invested some capital in certain
stocks and bonds the value of which now seemed
uncertain.</p>

<p>“And if I have to lose it&mdash;I have to, I suppose,”
concluded Joe’s father, resignedly. “Now,
my boy, tell me about yourself&mdash;and&mdash;baseball,”
and he smiled, for he knew Joe’s hobby.</p>

<p>Father and son talked at some length, and then,
as Mr. Matson had about finished work for the
day, the two set out for home together. On the
way Joe met his old chum, Tom Davis, and they
went over again the many good times in which
they had taken part.</p>

<p>Joe liked his home&mdash;he liked his home town,
and his old chums, but still he wished to get into
the new life that had called him.</p>

<p>He was not sorry, therefore, when, a few days
later he received a telegram from Mr. Mack, telling
him to report at once at Montville.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe!” exclaimed his mother. “Do you
really have to go so soon?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so, Momsey,” he answered. “You
see the league season will soon open and I want to
begin at the beginning. This is my life work, and
I can’t lose any time.”</p>

<p>“Pitching ball a life work!” sighed Mrs. Matson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
“Oh, Joe! if it was only preaching&mdash;or
something like that.”</p>

<p>“Let the boy alone, Mother,” said Mr. Matson,
with a good-humored twinkle in his eye. “We
can’t all be ministers, and I’d rather have a world
series winner in my family than a poor lawyer or
doctor. He’ll do more good in society, too.
Good luck to you, Joe.”</p>

<p>But Joe was not to get away to the South as
quietly as he hoped. He was importuned by his
old baseball chums to pitch an exhibition game for
them, but he did not think it wise, under the circumstances,
so declined.</p>

<p>But they wanted to do him honor, and, learning
through Tom Davis&mdash;who, I may say in passing,
got the secret from Clara&mdash;when Joe’s train
was to leave, many of the old members of the
Silver Stars gathered to wish their hero Godspeed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Baseball Joe?” was
the cry outside the station, whither Joe had gone
with his sister and mother, his father having bidden
him good-bye earlier.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Joe Matson?”</p>

<p>“<em>He’s&mdash;all&mdash;right!</em>” came the staccato reply.</p>

<p>Again the demand:</p>

<p>“Who’s all right?”</p>

<p>“<em>Baseball Joe!</em>”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what&mdash;what does it mean?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Mrs. Matson in bewilderment as she sat near her
son in the station, and heard the cries.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just the boys,” said Joe, easily.</p>

<p>“They’re giving Joe a send-off,” explained
Clara.</p>

<p>Quite a crowd gathered as the members of the
amateur nine cheered Joe again and again. Many
other boys joined in, and the scene about the railroad
depot was one of excitement.</p>

<p>“What’s going on?” asked a stranger.</p>

<p>“Joe Matson’s going off,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Who’s Joe Matson?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” The lad looked at the
man in half-contempt. “Why, he pitched a winning
game for Yale against Princeton, and now
he’s going to the Pittstons of the Central League.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Hum. Is that he?” and the man
pointed to the figure of our hero, surrounded by
his friends.</p>

<p>“That’s him! Say, I wish he was me!” and
the lad looked enviously at Joe.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I never knew baseball was so&mdash;so popular,”
said Mrs. Matson to Clara, as the shouting
and cheers grew, while Joe resisted an attempt
on the part of the lads to carry him on their
shoulders.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s as much Joe as it is the game,”
answered Clara, proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Three cheers for Joe!” were called for, and
given with a will.</p>

<p>Again came the question as to who was all right,
and the usual answer followed. Joe was shaking
hands with two lads at once, and trying to respond
to a dozen requests for letters, or passes to the
league games.</p>

<p>Then came the whistle of the train, more hurried
good-byes, a last kiss for his mother and
sister&mdash;final cheers&mdash;shouts&mdash;calls for good
wishes&mdash;and Joe was on his way to the Southern
baseball camp.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>AN ACCUSATION</small></h2>


<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Joe, as he sank into a car
seat and placed his valise beside him. “Some
doings&mdash;those!”</p>

<p>Several passengers looked at him, smiling and
appreciative. They had seen and heard the parting
ovation tendered to our hero, and they understood
what it meant.</p>

<p>Joe waved his hand out of the window as the
train sped on, and then settled back to collect his
thoughts which, truth to tell, were running riot.</p>

<p>Pulling from his pocket some books on baseball,
one of which contained statistics regarding the
Central League, Joe began poring over them.
He wanted to learn all he could about the organization
with which he had cast his fortunes.</p>

<p>And a few words of explanation concerning the
Central League may not be unappreciated by my
readers.</p>

<p>In the first place let me be perfectly frank, and
state that the Central League was not one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
big ones. I have not masqueraded a major league
under that title. Some day I hope to tell you some
stories concerning one of the larger leagues, but
not in this volume.</p>

<p>And in the second place Joe realized that he
was not going to astonish the world by his performances
in this small league. He knew it was
but a “bush league,” in a sense, yet he had read
enough of it to know that it was composed of
clean-cut clubs and players, and that it bore a
good reputation. Many a major league player
had graduated from this same Central, and Joe&mdash;well,
to put it modestly&mdash;had great hopes.</p>

<p>The Central League was of the Middle West.
It played its eight clubs over a circuit composed of
eight well-known cities, which for the purposes of
this story I have seen fit to designate as follows:
Clevefield, Pittston (to which club Joe had been
signed), Delamont, Washburg, Buffington, Loston,
Manhattan and Newkirk. Perhaps, as the
story progresses, you may recognize, more or less
successfully, certain players and certain localities.
With that I have nothing to do.</p>

<p>The train sped on, stopping at various stations,
but Joe took little interest in the passing scenery,
or in what took place in his coach. He was busy
over his baseball “dope,” by which I mean the
statistics regarding players, their averages, and so
forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“And my name will soon be among ’em!”
exulted Joe.</p>

<p>As the train was pulling out of a small station,
Joe looked out of the window, and, to his surprise,
saw, sitting on a baggage truck, the same
tramp he had saved from the freight train some
days before.</p>

<p>“Hum!” mused Joe. “If he’s beating his way
on the railroad he hasn’t gotten very far,” for
this was not many miles from Riverside. “I guess
he’s a sure-enough hobo, all right. Too bad!”</p>

<p>Others beside Joe seemed to have noticed the
tramp, who, however, had not looked at our hero.
One of two men in the seat back of Joe spoke, and
said:</p>

<p>“I say, Reynolds, see that tramp sitting there?”</p>

<p>“You mean the one on the truck?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you recognize him?”</p>

<p>“Recognize him? I should say not. I’m not in
the habit of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Easy, old man. Would you be surprised if I
told you that many times you’ve taken your hat
off to that same tramp, and cheered him until you
were hoarse?”</p>

<p>“Get out!”</p>

<p>“It’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who he is now&mdash;not much, to
judge by his looks; but that’s old Pop Dutton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
who, in his day, was one of the best pitchers Boston
ever owned. He was a wonder!”</p>

<p>“Is that Pop Dutton?”</p>

<p>“That’s the wreck of him!”</p>

<p>“How have the mighty fallen,” was the
whispered comment. “Poor old Pop! Indeed,
many a time I have taken my hat off to him! He
sure was a wonder. What caused his downfall?”</p>

<p>“Bad companions&mdash;that and&mdash;drink.”</p>

<p>“Too bad!”</p>

<p>Joe felt an irresistible impulse to turn around
and speak to the two men. But he refrained, perhaps
wisely.</p>

<p>“And to think that I saved his life!” mused
Joe. “No wonder he talked as he did. Pop
Dutton! Why, I’ve often read of him. He
pitched many a no-hit no-run game. And now
look at him!”</p>

<p>As the train pulled out Joe saw the wreck of
what had once been a fine man stagger across the
platform. A railroad man had driven him from
the truck. Joe’s heart was sore.</p>

<p>He realized that in baseball there were many
temptations, and he knew that many a fine young
fellow had succumbed to them. But he felt himself
strong enough to resist.</p>

<p>If Joe expected to make the trip South with
speed and comfort he was soon to realize that it
was not to be. Late that afternoon the train came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to an unexpected stop, and on the passengers inquiring
what was the trouble, the conductor informed
them that, because of a wreck ahead, they
would be delayed at a little country station for
several hours.</p>

<p>There were expostulations, sharp remarks and
various sorts of suggestions offered by the passengers,
all of whom seemed to be in a hurry. Joe,
himself, regretted the delay, but he did not see
how it could be avoided.</p>

<p>“The company ought to be sued!” declared a
young man whose rather “loud” clothes proclaimed
him for an up-to-date follower of “fashion.”
He had with him a valise of peculiar make&mdash;rather
conspicuous&mdash;and it looked to be of
foreign manufacture. In fact, everything about
him was rather striking.</p>

<p>“I ought to be in New York now,” this young
chap went on, as though everyone in the train was
interested in his fortunes and misfortunes. “This
delay is uncalled for! I shall start suit against this
railroad. It’s always having wrecks. Can’t we
go on, my good man?” he asked the conductor,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Not unless you go on ahead and shove the
wreck out of the way,” was the sharp answer.</p>

<p>“I shall report you!” said the youth, loftily.</p>

<p>“Do! It won’t be the first time I’ve been reported&mdash;my
good fellow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The youth flushed and, taking his valise, left
the car to enter the small railway station. Several
other passengers, including Joe, did the same, for
the car was hot and stuffy.</p>

<p>Joe took a seat near one where the modish
young man set down his queer valise. Some of
the other passengers, after leaving their baggage
inside, went out on the platform to stroll about.
Joe noted that the young man had gone to the
telegraph office to send a message.</p>

<p>Our hero having nothing else to do, proceeded
to look over more of his baseball information.
He was deep in a study of batting averages when
he was aware that someone stood in front of him.</p>

<p>It was the young man, who had his valise open,
and on his face was a puzzled expression, mingled
with one of anger.</p>

<p>“I say now! I say!” exclaimed the young chap.
“This won’t do! It won’t do at all, you know!”
and he looked sharply at Joe.</p>

<p>“Are you speaking to me?” asked the young
pitcher. “If you are I don’t know what it is that
won’t do&mdash;and I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do at all, you know!” went on the
young man, speaking with what he probably intended
to be an English accent. “It won’t do!”</p>

<p>“What won’t?” asked Joe sharply.</p>

<p>“Why, taking things out of my valise, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
know. There’s a gold watch and some jewelry
missing&mdash;my sister’s jewelry. It won’t do!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that I had anything to do
with taking jewelry out of your valise?” asked
Joe hotly.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;you were sitting next to it. I went
to send a wire&mdash;when I come back my stuff is missing,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried the young pitcher in anger.
“Do you mean to accuse me?” and he jumped to
his feet and faced the young man. “Do you?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes, I think I do,” was the answer.
“You were next my bag, you know, and&mdash;well,
my stuff is gone. It won’t do. It won’t do
at all, you know!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>IN TRAINING</small></h2>


<p>For a moment Joe stood glaring at the modish
young man who had accused him. The latter returned
the look steadily. There were superciliousness,
contempt and an abiding sense of his
own superiority in the look, and Joe resented these
too-well displayed feelings fully as much as he did
the accusation.</p>

<p>Then a calmer mood came over the young
pitcher; he recalled the training at Yale&mdash;the
training that had come when he had been in
troublesome situations&mdash;and Joe laughed. It was
that laugh which formed a safety-valve for him.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what there is to laugh at,” sneered
the young man. “My valise has been opened, and
my watch and some jewelry taken.”</p>

<p>“Well, what have I got to do with it?” demanded
Joe hotly. “I’m not a detective or a
police officer!”</p>

<p>Joe glanced from the youth to the bag in question.
It was a peculiar satchel, made of some odd
leather, and evidently constructed for heavy use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
It was such a bag as Joe had never seen before. It
was open now, and there could be noticed in it
a confused mass of clothes, collars, shirts of gaudy
pattern and scarfs of even gaudier hues.</p>

<p>The young pitcher also noticed that the bag
bore on one end the initials “R. V.” while below
them was the name of the city where young “R.
V.” lived&mdash;Goldsboro, N. C.</p>

<p>“Suffering cats!” thought Joe, as he noted that.
“He lives in Goldsboro. Montville is just outside
that. I hope I don’t meet this nuisance when I’m
at the training camp.”</p>

<p>“I did not assume that you were an officer,”
answered the young man, who, for the present,
must be known only as “R. V.” “But you were
the only one near my valise, which was opened
when I went to send that wire. Now it’s up to
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Joe, trying not to let his
rather quick temper get the better of him. “Nothing
is ‘up to me,’ as you call it. I didn’t touch
your valise. I didn’t even know I sat near it until
you called my attention to it. And if it was
opened, and something taken out, I beg to assure
you that I had nothing to do with it. That’s all!”</p>

<p>“But if you didn’t take it; who did?” asked
“R. V.” in some bewilderment.</p>

<p>“How should I know?” retorted Joe, coolly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
“And I’d advise you to be more careful after this,
in making accusations.”</p>

<p>He spoke rather loudly&mdash;in fact so did “R. V.,”
and it was but natural that several of the delayed
passengers should gather outside the station, attracted
by the voices.</p>

<p>Some of them looked in through the opened
windows and doors, and, seeing nothing more than
what seemed to be an ordinary dispute, strolled
on.</p>

<p>“But this won’t do,” insisted “R. V.,” which
expression seemed to be a favorite with him.
“This won’t do at all, you know, my good fellow.
My watch is gone, and my sister’s jewelry. It
won’t do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, I have nothing to do with it,” declared
Joe, “and I don’t want to hear any more about it.
This ends it&mdash;see!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I say! You were nearest to my valise,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” interrupted the ticket
agent, coming from his little office. “What’s the
row here?”</p>

<p>“My valise!” exclaimed “R. V.” angrily. “It’s
been opened, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He thinks I did it just because I sat near it!”
broke in Joe, determined to get in his word first.
“It’s absurd! I never touched his baggage.”</p>

<p>The agent looked at the modish youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that the only reason you accuse him&mdash;because
he sat near your satchel?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes, to be sure. Isn’t that reason
enough?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be for me, young man. I don’t
see that you can do anything about it. You say he
took something of yours, and he says he didn’t.
That’s six of one and a half-dozen of the other.
You ought to have your satchel locked if you
carry valuables in it.”</p>

<p>“It was locked, but I opened it and forgot to
lock it again.”</p>

<p>“That’s up to you then,” and the agent’s sympathies
seemed to be with Joe.</p>

<p>“Well, but it won’t do, you know. It won’t do
at all!” protested “R. V.,” this time pleadingly.
“I must have my things back!”</p>

<p>“Then you had better go to the police,” broke
in the agent.</p>

<p>“If you like, though I’ve never done such a
thing before, I’ll submit to a search,” said Joe, the
red blood mantling to his cheeks as he thought of
the needless indignity. “I can refer to several
well-known persons who will vouch for me, but if
you feel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All aboard!” suddenly called the conductor
of the stalled train, coming into the depot. “We
just got word that we can proceed. If we can
reach the next junction before the fast mail, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
can go ahead of her and get around the wreck.
Lively now! All aboard!”</p>

<p>There was a scramble in which Joe and “R. V.”
took a part. All of the passengers were anxious
to proceed, and if haste meant that they could
avoid further delay they were willing to hasten.
The engineer whistled impatiently, and men and
women scrambled into the coaches they had left.</p>

<p>“R. V.” caught up his peculiar bag and without
another look at Joe, got aboard. For a moment
the young pitcher had an idea of insisting on
having the unpleasant matter settled, but he, too,
wanted to go on. At any rate no one he knew or
cared about had heard the unjust accusation made,
and if he insisted on vindication, by means of a
personal search, it might lead to unpleasant complications.</p>

<p>“Even if he saw that I didn’t have his truck on
me that wouldn’t prove anything to him&mdash;he’d say
it ‘wouldn’t do,’” thought Joe. “He’s altogether
too positive.”</p>

<p>And so, leaving the matter of the missing articles
unsettled, Joe sprinted for the train.</p>

<p>Joe saw his accuser enter the rear coach, while
the young ball player took his place in the second
coach, where he had been before.</p>

<p>“If he wants to take up this matter again he
knows I’m aboard,” mused Joe, as the train pulled
out of the way-station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>But the matter was not reopened, and when the
junction was reached our hero saw “R. V.” hurrying
off to make other connections. As he turned
away, however, he favored Joe with a look that
was not altogether pleasant.</p>

<p>The remainder of our hero’s trip to Montville
was uneventful, save that it was rather monotonous,
and, the further South he went the worse
the railroad service became, until he found that he
was going to be nearly half a day late.</p>

<p>But he was not expected at any special time, and
he knew that he had done the best possible. Arriving
in Montville, which he found to be a typical
small Southern town, Joe put up at the hotel where
he had been told by “Jimmie” Mack to take
quarters.</p>

<p>“Are any of the Pittston players around&mdash;is
Mr. Gregory here?” asked Joe of the clerk, after
registering. It was shortly after two o’clock.</p>

<p>“They’re all out practicing, I believe,” was the
answer. “Mr. Gregory was here a while ago, but
I reckon as how he-all went out to the field, too.
Are you a member of the nine, sir?”</p>

<p>The clerk really said “suh,” but the peculiarities
of Southern talk are too well known to need
imitating.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I am, but I’ve only just
joined,” answered Joe, with a smile. “I’m one of
the new pitchers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Glad to know you. We enjoy having you ball
players here. It sort of livens things up. I believe
your team is going to cross bats with our
home team Saturday.”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” exclaimed Joe, who was just
“aching” to get into a game again.</p>

<p>He ate a light luncheon and then, inquiring his
way, went out to the ball field.</p>

<p>He was rather disappointed at first. It was not
as good as the one where the Silver Stars played&mdash;not
as well laid out or kept up, and the grandstand
was only about half as large.</p>

<p>“But of course it’s only a practice field,” reasoned
Joe, as he looked about for a sight of “Jimmie”
Mack, whom alone he knew. “The home
field at Pittston will probably be all right. Still,
I’ve got to remember that I’m not playing in a
major league. This will do for a start.”</p>

<p>He looked over the men with whom he was to
associate and play ball for the next year or so&mdash;perhaps
longer. The members of the team were
throwing and catching&mdash;some were batting flies,
and laying down grounders for others to catch or
pick up. One or two were practicing “fungo”
batting. Up near the grandstand a couple of
pitchers were “warming-up,” while the catchers
were receiving the balls in their big mitts.</p>

<p>Several small and worshipping boys were on
hand, as always is the case, gathering up the discarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bats, running after passed balls and bringing
water to their heroes.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m here, anyhow,” thought Joe. “Now
to see what sort of a stab I can make at professional
ball.”</p>

<p>No one seemed to notice the advent of the
young pitcher on the field, and if he expected to
receive an ovation, such as was accorded to him
when he left home, Joe was grievously disappointed.</p>

<p>But I do not believe Joe Matson looked for
anything of the sort. In fact I know he did not,
for Joe was a sensible lad. He realized that however
good a college player he might be he was
now entering the ranks of men who made their
living at ball playing. And there is a great deal
of difference between doing a thing for fun, and
doing it to get your bread and butter&mdash;a heap of
difference.</p>

<p>Joe stood on the edge of the diamond looking
at the players. They seemed to be a clean-cut set
of young fellows. One or two looked to be veterans
at the game, and here and there Joe could
pick out one whose hair was turning the least little
bit gray. He wondered if they had slid down the
scale, and, finding their powers waning, had gotten
out of the big leagues to take it a little easier
in one of the “bush” variety.</p>

<p>“But it’s baseball&mdash;it’s a start&mdash;it’s just what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
I want!” thought Joe, as he drew a deep breath,
the odors of crushed green grass, the dry dust and
the whiff of leather mingling under the hot rays
of the Southern sun.</p>

<p>“It’s baseball, and that’s enough!” exulted
Joe.</p>

<p>“Well, I see you got here!” exclaimed a voice
behind him, and Joe turned to see “Jimmie”
Mack, in uniform, holding out a welcoming hand.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joe with a smile. “I’m a little
late, but&mdash;I’m here.”</p>

<p>“If the trains arrive on time down here everybody
worries,” went on Jimmie. “They think
something is going to happen. Did you bring a
uniform?”</p>

<p>Joe indicated his valise, into which he had hastily
stuffed, at the hotel, one of his old suits.</p>

<p>“Well, slip it on&mdash;take any dressing room
that’s vacant there,” and Jimmie motioned to the
grandstand. “Then come out and I’ll have you
meet the boys. We’re only doing light practice
as yet, but we’ll soon have to hump ourselves, for
the season will shortly open.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Gregory here?” asked Joe, feeling
that he ought to meet the manager of the team.</p>

<p>“He’ll be here before the day is over. Oh,
Harrison!” he called to a passing player, “come
over and meet Joe Matson, one of our new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
pitchers. Harrison tries to play centre,” explained
the assistant manager with a smile.</p>

<p>“Quit your kiddin’!” exclaimed the centre fielder
as he shook hands with Joe. “Glad to meet
you, son. You mustn’t mind Jimmie,” he went on.
“Ever played before?”</p>

<p>“Not professionally.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I meant.”</p>

<p>“Joe’s the boy who pitched Yale to the championship
this year,” explained Jimmie Mack.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! Yes, I heard about that. Well,
hope you like it here. I’m going out in the field.
See you there,” and Harrison passed on.</p>

<p>Joe lost no time in changing into his playing
togs. The dressing rooms in the Montville grandstand
were only apologies compared with what Joe
was used to.</p>

<p>But he knew that this was only a training camp,
and that they would not be here long.</p>

<p>He walked out on the field, feeling a little nervous
and rather lonesome&mdash;“like a cat in a
strange garret,” as he wrote home to his folks.
But Joe’s school and college training stood him
in good stead, and when he had been introduced
to most of the players, who welcomed him warmly,
he felt more at home.</p>

<p>Then he went out in the field, and began catching
flies with the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I wish they’d put me at pitching,” mused
Joe. “That’s what I want to do.”</p>

<p>He was to learn that to make haste slowly is a
motto more or less followed by professional ball
players. There would be time enough to put on
speed before the season closed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE CLASH</small></h2>


<p>“That’s the way! Line ’em out, now!”</p>

<p>“Put some speed into that!”</p>

<p>“Look out for a high one!”</p>

<p>“Oh, get farther back! I’m going to knock the
cover off this time!”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the cries and calls
that echoed over the ball field at Montville. The
occasion was the daily practice of the Pittston nine,
and orders had come from the manager and
trainer to start in on more lively work. It was
Joe’s third day with the professionals.</p>

<p>He had made the acquaintance of all the players,
but as yet had neither admitted, nor been admitted
to, a real friendship with any of them. It
was too early.</p>

<p>Joe held back because he was naturally a bit
diffident. Then, too, most of the men were older
than he, and with one exception they had been in
the professional ranks for several seasons. That
one exception was Charlie Hall, who played short.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
He, like Joe, had been taken that Spring from the
amateur ranks. Hall had played on a Western
college team, and had been picked out by one of
the ever-present professional scouts.</p>

<p>With Charlie, Joe felt more at home than with
any of the others and yet he felt that soon he
would have good friends among the older men.</p>

<p>On their part they did not become friendly with
Joe at once simply for the reason that they wanted
to “size him up,” or “get his number,” as Jimmie
Mack put it in speaking of the matter.</p>

<p>“But they’ll cotton to you after a bit, Joe,”
said the assistant manager, “and you’ll like them,
too. Don’t get discouraged.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” was the answer.</p>

<p>There was one man on the team, though, with
whom Joe felt that he would never be on friendly
terms, and this was Jake Collin, one of the pitchers&mdash;the
chief pitcher and mainstay of the nine on
the mound, from what Joe picked up by hearing
the other men talk. And Collin himself was not
at all modest about his ability. That he had ability
Joe was ready to concede. And Collin wanted
everyone else to know it, too. He was always
talking about his record, and his batting average,
which, to do him credit, was good.</p>

<p>Collin was not much older than Joe, but a rather
fast life and hard living counted for more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
years. Joe heard whispers that Collin could not
last much longer.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a realization of this that made
Collin rather resent the arrival of our hero on the
Pittston nine. For he gave Joe but a cold greeting,
and, as he moved off to practice, the young
pitcher could hear him saying something about
“college dudes thinking they can play professional
ball.”</p>

<p>Joe’s faced flushed, but he said nothing. It was
something that called more for deeds than words.</p>

<p>“Everybody lively now! I want some snappy
work!” called Jimmie Mack as the practice progressed.
“If we’re going to play the Montville
team Saturday we want to snow them under. A
win by a few runs won’t be the thing at all, and,
let me tell you, those boys can play ball.</p>

<p>“So step lively, everybody. Run bases as if you
meant to get back home some time this week. Slug
the ball until the cover comes off. And you, Collin,
get a little more speed on your delivery. Is
your arm sore?”</p>

<p>“Arm sore? I guess not! I’m all right!” and
the man’s eyes snapped angrily.</p>

<p>“Well, then, show it. Let’s see what you’ve
got up your sleeve, anyhow. Here comes Gregory
now&mdash;he’ll catch a few for you, and then we’ll do
some batting.”</p>

<p>The manager, whom Joe had met and liked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
came out to join in the practice. He nodded to
our hero, and then took Collin off to one side, to
give him some instructions.</p>

<p>Joe under the direction of Jimmie Mack was
allowed to do some pitching now. With Terry
Hanson the left fielder, to back him up, Joe began
throwing in the balls on a space in front of the
grandstand.</p>

<p>Joe noticed that Collin regarded him sharply in
the intervals of his own practice, but he was prepared
for a little professional jealousy, and knew
how to take it. He had seen it manifested often
enough at school and college, though there the
spirit of the university was paramount to personal
triumph&mdash;every player was willing to sacrifice himself
that the team might win. And, in a large
measure, of course, this is so in professional baseball.
But human nature is human nature, whether
one is playing for money or for glory, and in
perhaps no other sport where money counts for
as much as it does in baseball, will you find more
of the spirit of the school than in the ranks of the
diamond professionals.</p>

<p>“Take it easy, Joe; take it easy,” advised
Terry, with a good-natured smile, as the lad stung
in the balls. “You’ve got speed, and I’m willing
to admit it without having you split my mitt. But
save yourself for a game. You’re not trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
pitch anyone out now, you know, and there’s no
one looking at you.”</p>

<p>“I guess I forgot this was just practice,” admitted
Joe with a laugh. “I’ll throw in some
easy ones.”</p>

<p>He did, and saw an admiring look on Terry’s
face.</p>

<p>“They seem to have the punch&mdash;that’s a nice
little drop you’ve got. But don’t work it too
much. Vary your delivery.”</p>

<p>From time to time as the practice proceeded
Terry gave Joe good advice. Occasionally this
would be supplemented by something Mack or
Gregory would say and Joe took it all in, resolving
to profit by it.</p>

<p>The practice came to an end, and the players
were advised by their trainer, Mike McGuire, to
take walks in the country round-about.</p>

<p>“It’ll be good for your legs and wind,” was
the comment.</p>

<p>Joe enjoyed this almost as much as the work on
the field, for the country was new to him and a
source of constant delight. He went out with
some of the men, and again would stroll off by
himself.</p>

<p>Saturday, the day when the first practice game
was to be played, found Joe a bit nervous. He
wondered whether he would get a chance to pitch.
So too, for that matter, did Tom Tooley, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
south-paw moundman, who was nearer Joe’s age
than was Collin.</p>

<p>“Who’s going to be the battery?” was heard
on all sides as the Pittston players went to the
grounds.</p>

<p>“The old man hasn’t given it out yet,” was the
reply of Jimmie Mack. The “old man” was always
the manager, and the term conveyed no hint
of disrespect.</p>

<p>The Montville team, a semi-professional one,
was a good bit like the Silver Stars, Joe thought,
when he saw the members run out on the diamond
for practice. Still they looked to be a “husky
lot,” as he admitted, and he was glad of it, for he
wanted to see what he and his team-mates could
do against a good aggregation.</p>

<p>“Play ball! Play ball!” called the umpire, as
he dusted off the home plate. There was quite a
crowd present, and when Gregory handed over his
batting list the umpire made the announcement:</p>

<p>“Batteries&mdash;for Pittston, Collin and Gregory.
For Montville, Smith and Jennings.”</p>

<p>“Um. He’s going to pitch Collin,” murmured
Tooley in Joe’s ear. “That means we warm the
bench.”</p>

<p>Joe was a little disappointed, but he tried not
to show it.</p>

<p>This first game was neither better nor worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
than many others. Naturally the playing was
ragged under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The Pittstons had everything to lose by being
beaten and not much to gain if they won the game.
On the other hand the home nine had much to gain
in case they should win. So they took rather desperate
chances.</p>

<p>Pittston was first at bat, and succeeded in getting
two runs over. Then came a slump, and in
quick succession three men went down, two being
struck out. The Montville pitcher was a professional
who had been in a big league, but who had
drifted to a minor, and finally landed in the semi-pro
ranks. But he had some good “heaves” left.</p>

<p>Collin walked to the mound with a rather bored
air of superiority. There was a little whispered
conference between him and the catcher-manager,
and the second half of the first inning began.</p>

<p>Collin did well, and though hit twice for singles,
not a run came in, and the home team was credited
with a zero on the score-board.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can play some!” cried one of
the professionals.</p>

<p>“What are you crowing over?” demanded Jimmie
Mack. “If we win this I suppose you fellows
will want medals! Why this is nothing but a kid
bunch we’re up against.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let ’em fool you, though,” advised the
manager, who overheard the talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, to the surprise and dismay of all, the
home team proceeded to “do things” to the professionals.
They began making runs, and succeeded
in stopping the winning streak of the Pittstons.</p>

<p>The detailed play would not interest you, and,
for that matter it was a thing the Pittstons did not
like to recall afterward. There was a bad slump,
and when the seventh inning arrived Gregory
called:</p>

<p>“Matson, you bat for Collin.”</p>

<p>Joe felt the blood rush to his face.</p>

<p>“Does that mean I’m going to be taken out of
the box?” asked the chief pitcher, stalking angrily
over to the manager.</p>

<p>“It means just that, son. I can’t afford to lose
this game, and we sure will the way you’re feedin’
’em in to ’em. I guess you drew it a little too fine
the last few days. You need a rest.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” protested Collin.</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” said Gregory, sharply. “Joe
Matson will pitch. It’s a chance, but I’ve got to
take it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Tooley?” demanded
Collin. “What do you want to go shove this raw
college jake in ahead of us for? Say!”</p>

<p>“Go to the bench!” ordered the manager. “I
know what I’m doing, Collin!”</p>

<p>The pitcher seemed about to say something, and
the look he gave Joe was far from friendly. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
realizing that he was under the manager’s orders,
he stalked to the bench.</p>

<p>“You won’t do this again, if I can prevent it!”
snapped Collin at Joe, as he passed him. “I’ll
run you out of the league, if you try to come it
over me!”</p>

<p>Only a few players heard him, and one or two
whispered to him to quiet down, but he glared at
Joe, who felt far from comfortable.</p>

<p>But he was to have his chance to pitch at last.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>A STRAIGHT THROW</small></h2>


<p>Joe had hopes of making a safe hit when he
came up, but pitchers are proverbially bad batsmen
and our hero was no exception. I wish I
could say that he “slammed one out for a home
run, and came in amid wild applause,” but truth
compels me to state that Joe only knocked a little
pop fly which dropped neatly into the hands of the
second baseman, and Joe went back to the bench.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Jimmie Mack, “you’re
not here to bat&mdash;we count on you to pitch,
though of course if you can hit the ball do it&mdash;every
time. But don’t get nervous.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>And, to do him justice, his nerves were in excellent
shape. He had not played on the school
and Yale nines for nothing, and he had faced
many a crisis fully as acute as the present one.</p>

<p>Then, too, the action of Collin must have had its
effect. It was not pleasant for Joe to feel that he
had won the enmity of the chief pitcher of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
nine. But our hero resolved to do his best and
let other matters take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Whether it was the advent of Joe into the game,
or because matters would have turned out that
way anyhow, was not disclosed, but Pittston seemed
to brace up, and that inning added three runs to
their score, which put them on even terms with the
home team&mdash;the members of which were playing
phenomenal ball.</p>

<p>“And now we’ve got to go in and beat them!”
exclaimed Manager Gregory, as his men took the
field. “Joe, I want to see what you can do.”</p>

<p>Enough to make any young pitcher nervous;
was it not? Yet Joe kept his nerves in check&mdash;no
easy matter&mdash;and walked to the box with all the
ease he could muster.</p>

<p>He fingered the ball for a moment, rubbed a
little dirt on it&mdash;not that the spheroid needed it,
but it gave him a chance to look at Gregory and
catch his signal for a fast out. He nodded comprehendingly,
having mastered the signals, and
wound up for his first delivery.</p>

<p>“Ball one!” howled the umpire.</p>

<p>Joe was a little nettled. He was sure it had
gone cleanly over the plate, curving out just as he
intended it should, and yet it was called a ball.
But he concealed his chagrin, and caught the horsehide
which Gregory threw back to him&mdash;the catcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hesitating just the least bit, and with a look at
the umpire which said much.</p>

<p>Again came the signal for a fast out.</p>

<p>Joe nodded.</p>

<p>Once more the young pitcher threw and this
time, though the batter swung desperately at it,
not having moved his stick before, there came
from the umpire the welcome cry of:</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;one!”</p>

<p>Joe was beginning to make good.</p>

<p>I shall not weary you with a full account of the
game. I have other, and more interesting contests
to tell of as we proceed. Sufficient to say
that while Joe did not “set the river afire,” he
did strike out three men that inning, after a two-bagger
had been made. But Joe “tightened up,”
just in time to prevent a run coming in, and the
score was still a tie when the last man was out.</p>

<p>In the next inning Pittston managed, by hard
work, and a close decision on the part of the umpire,
to add another run to their score. This put
them one ahead, and the struggle now was to hold
their opponents hitless. It devolved upon Joe to
accomplish this.</p>

<p>And he did it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was no great feat, as baseball history
goes, but it meant much to him&mdash;a raw recruit in
his first professional league, “bush” though it
was. Joe made good, and when he struck out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
last man (one of the best hitters, too, by the way)
there was an enthusiastic scene on that little ball
field.</p>

<p>“Good, Joe! Good!” cried Jimmie Mack, and
even the rather staid Mr. Gregory condescended
to smile and say:</p>

<p>“I thought you could do it!”</p>

<p>Collin, suffering from his turn-down, sulked on
the bench, and growled:</p>

<p>“I’ll show that young upstart! He can’t come
here and walk over me.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t walk over you&mdash;he pitched over
you,” said George Lee, the second baseman. “He
pitched good ball.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Just a fluke! If I hadn’t strained my
arm yesterday I’d have made this home team look
like a sick cat!”</p>

<p>“Post-mortems are out of style,” said Lee.
“Be a sport! It’s all in the game!”</p>

<p>“Um!” growled Collin, surlily.</p>

<p>The team played the game all over again at the
hotel that night. Of course it was not much of a
victory, close as it was, but it showed of what stuff
the players were made, and it gave many, who
were ignorant of Joe’s abilities, an insight into
what he could do.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of my find?” asked
Jimmie Mack of his chief that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, Jimmie! All right! I think we’ll
make a ball-player of him yet.”</p>

<p>“So do I. And the blessed part of it is that he
hasn’t got a swelled head from his college work.
That’s the saving grace of it. Yes, I think Joe is
due to arrive soon.”</p>

<p>If Joe had heard this perhaps he would have
resented it somewhat. Surely, after having supplanted
a veteran pitcher, even though of no great
ability, and won his first professional game, Joe
might have been excused for patting himself on the
back, and feeling proud. And he did, too, in a
sense.</p>

<p>But perhaps it was just as well he did not hear
himself discussed. Anyhow, he was up in his room
writing home.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and in the afternoon
Joe went for a long walk. He asked several of
the men to go with him, but they all made good-enough
excuses, so Joe set off by himself.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day, a little too warm, but
then that was to be expected in the South, and Joe
was dressed for it. As he walked along a country
road he came to a parting of the ways; a weather-beaten
sign-post informed him that one highway
led to North Ford, while the other would take him
to Goldsboro.</p>

<p>“Goldsboro; eh?” mused Joe. “That’s where
that ‘R. V.’ fellow lives, who thought I robbed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
valise. I wonder if I’ll ever meet him? I’ve a
good notion to take a chance, and walk over that
way. I can ask him if he found his stuff. Maybe
it’s risky, but I’m going to do it.”</p>

<p>He set off at a swinging pace to limber up his
muscles, thinking of many things, and wondering,
if, after all, he was going to like professional baseball.
Certainly he had started in as well as could
be expected, save for the enmity of Collin.</p>

<p>Joe got out into the open country and breathed
deeply of the sweet air. The road swept along in
a gentle curve, on one side being deep woods, while
on the other was a rather steep descent to the valley
below. In places the road approached close to
the edge of a steep cliff.</p>

<p>As the young pitcher strode along he heard behind
him the clatter of hoofs. It was a galloping
horse, and the rattle of wheels told that the
animal was drawing a carriage.</p>

<p>“Someone’s in a hurry,” mused Joe. “Going
for a doctor, maybe.”</p>

<p>A moment later he saw what he knew might at
any moment become a tragedy.</p>

<p>A spirited horse, attached to a light carriage,
dashed around a bend in the road, coming straight
for Joe. And in the carriage was a young girl,
whose fear-blanched face told that she realized
her danger. A broken, dangling rein showed that
she had tried in vain to stop the runaway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe formed a sudden resolve. He knew something
of horses, and had more than once stopped a
frightened animal. He ran forward, intending to
cut across the path of this one, and grasp the
bridle.</p>

<p>But as the horse headed for him, and caught
sight of the youth, it swerved to one side, and
dashed across an intervening field, straight for the
steep cliff.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Joe, as if that meant anything.</p>

<p>The girl screamed, and seemed about to jump.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to stop that horse!” gasped Joe, and
he broke into a run. Then the uselessness of this
came to him and he stopped.</p>

<p>At his feet were several large, round and
smooth stones. Hardly knowing why he picked
up one, just as the horse turned sideways to him.</p>

<p>“If I could only hit him on the head, and stun
him so that he’d stop before he gets to the cliff!”
thought Joe. “If I don’t he’ll go over sure as
fate!”</p>

<p>The next instant he threw.</p>

<p>Straight and true went the stone, and struck the
horse hard on the head.</p>

<p>The animal reared, then staggered. It tried to
keep on, but the blow had been a disabling one.
It tried to keep on its legs but they crumpled under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the beast, and the next moment it went down in a
heap, almost on the verge of the steep descent.</p>

<p>The carriage swerved and ran partly up on the
prostrate animal, while the shock of the sudden
stop threw the girl out on the soft grass, where
she lay in a crumpled heap.</p>

<p>Joe sprinted forward.</p>

<p>“I hope I did the right thing, after all,” he
panted. “I hope she isn’t killed!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE GIRL</small></h2>


<p>Joe Matson bent over the unconscious girl,
and, even in the excitement of the moment, out of
breath as he was from his fast run, he could not
but note how pretty she was. Though now her
cheeks that must usually be pink with the flush of
health, were pale. She lay in a heap on the grass,
at the side of the overturned carriage, from which
the horse had partly freed itself. The animal was
now showing signs of recovering from the stunning
blow of the stone.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get her away from here,” decided
Joe. “If that brute starts kicking around he may
hurt her. I’ve got to pick her up and carry her.
She doesn’t look able to walk.”</p>

<p>In his sturdy arms he picked up the unconscious
girl, and carried her some distance off, placing her
on a grassy bank.</p>

<p>“Let’s see&mdash;what do you do when a girl
faints?” mused Joe, scratching his head in puzzled
fashion. “Water&mdash;that’s it&mdash;you have to
sprinkle her face with water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked about for some sign of a brook or
spring, and, listening, his ear caught a musical
trickle off to one side.</p>

<p>“Must be a stream over there,” he decided. He
glanced again at the girl before leaving her. She
gave no sign of returning consciousness, and one
hand, Joe noticed when he carried her, hung limp,
as though the wrist was broken.</p>

<p>“And she’s lucky to get off with that,” decided
the young pitcher. “I hope I did the right thing
by stopping the horse that way. She sure would
have gone over the cliff if I hadn’t.”</p>

<p>The horse, from which had gone all desire to
run farther, now struggled to its feet, and shook
itself once or twice to adjust the harness. It was
partly loose from it, and, with a plunge or two,
soon wholly freed itself.</p>

<p>“Run away again if you want to now,” exclaimed
Joe, shaking his fist at the brute. “You
can’t hurt anyone but yourself, anyhow. Jump
over the cliff if you like!”</p>

<p>But the horse did not seem to care for any such
performance now, and, after shaking himself
again, began nibbling the grass as though nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>“All right,” went on Joe, talking to the horse
for companionship, since the neighborhood seemed
deserted. “Stay there, old fellow. I may need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
you to get to a doctor, or to some house. She may
be badly hurt.”</p>

<p>For want of something better Joe used the top
of his cap in which to carry the water which he
found in a clear-running brook, not far from
where he had placed the girl.</p>

<p>The sprinkling of the first few drops of the cold
liquid on her face caused her to open her eyes.
Consciousness came back quickly, and, with a start,
she gazed up at Joe uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” he said, reassuringly.
“That is, I hope so. Do you think you are hurt
anywhere? Shall I get a doctor? Where do you
live?”</p>

<p>Afterward he realized that his hurried questions
had given her little chance to speak, but he meant
to make her feel that she would be taken care of.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what happened?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Your horse ran away,” Joe explained, with a
smile. “He’s over there now; not hurt, fortunately.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember now! Something frightened
Prince and he bolted. He never did it before.
Oh, I was so frightened. I tried&mdash;tried to stop
him, but could not. The rein broke.”</p>

<p>The girl sat up now, Joe’s arm about her, supporting
her, for she was much in need of assistance,
being weak and trembling.</p>

<p>“Then he bolted into a field,” she resumed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
“and he was headed for a cliff. Oh, how I tried
to stop him! But he wouldn’t. Then&mdash;then something&mdash;something
happened!”</p>

<p>She looked wonderingly at Joe.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid <em>I</em> happened it,” he said with
a smile. “I saw that your horse might go over
the cliff, so I threw a stone, and hit him on the
head. It stunned him, he fell, and threw you out.”</p>

<p>“I remember up to that point,” she said with
a faint smile. “I saw Prince go down, and I
thought we were going over the cliff. Oh, what an
escape!”</p>

<p>“And yet not altogether an escape,” remarked
Joe. “Your arm seems hurt.”</p>

<p>She glanced down in some surprise at her right
wrist, as though noticing it for the first time.
Then, as she moved it ever so slightly, a cry of
pain escaped her lips.</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it’s broken!” she faltered.</p>

<p>Joe took it tenderly in his hand.</p>

<p>“Only sprained, I think,” he said, gravely. “It
needs attention at once, though; I must get you a
doctor. Can you walk?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>She struggled to her feet with his help, the red
blood now surging into her pale cheeks, and making
her, Joe thought, more beautiful than ever.</p>

<p>“Be careful!” he exclaimed, as she swayed.
His arm was about her, so she did not fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;I guess I’m weaker than I thought,” she
murmured. “But it isn’t because I’m injured&mdash;except
my wrist. I think it must be the shock. Why,
there’s Prince!” she added, as she saw the grazing
horse. “He isn’t hurt!”</p>

<p>“No, I only stunned him with the stone I
threw,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, and so you threw a stone at him, and
stopped him?” She seemed in somewhat of a
daze.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What a splendid thrower you must be!”
There was admiration in her tones.</p>

<p>“It’s from playing ball,” explained Joe, modestly.
“I’m a pitcher on the Pittston nine. We’re
training over at Montville.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she murmured, understandingly.</p>

<p>“If I could get you some water to drink, it
would make you feel better,” said Joe. “Then I
might patch up the broken harness and get you
home. Do you live around here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just outside of Goldsboro. Perhaps you
could make a leaf answer for a cup,” she suggested.
“I believe I would like a little water. It
would do me good.”</p>

<p>She moistened her dry lips with her tongue as
Joe hastened back to the little brook. He managed
to curl an oak leaf into a rude but clean cup,
and brought back a little water. The girl sipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
it gratefully, and the effect was apparent at once.
She was able to stand alone.</p>

<p>“Now to see if I can get that horse of yours
hitched to the carriage,” spoke the young pitcher,
“that is, if the carriage isn’t broken.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully kind of you, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;” she
paused suggestively.</p>

<p>“I’m Joe Matson, formerly of Yale,” was our
hero’s answer, and, somehow, he felt not a little
proud of that “Yale.” After all, his university
training, incomplete though it had been, was not to
be despised.</p>

<p>“Oh, a Yale man!” her eyes were beginning to
sparkle now.</p>

<p>“But I gave it up to enter professional baseball,”
the young pitcher went on. “It’s my first
attempt. If you do not feel able to get into the
carriage&mdash;provided it’s in running shape&mdash;perhaps
I could take you to some house near here and send
word to your folks,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I can ride&mdash;provided, as you say,
the carriage is in shape to use,” she answered,
quickly. “I am Miss Varley. It’s awfully good
of you to take so much trouble.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” protested Joe. He noticed a
shadow of pain pass over her face, and she clasped
her sprained wrist in her left hand.</p>

<p>“That must hurt a lot, Miss Varley,” spoke Joe
with warm sympathy. “I know what a sprain is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I’ve had many a one. Let me wrap a cold, wet rag
around it. That will do until you can get to a
doctor and have him reduce it.”</p>

<p>Not waiting for permission Joe hurried back to
the brook, and dipped his handkerchief in the cold
water. This he bound tightly around the already
swelling wrist, tying it skillfully, for he knew something
about first aid work&mdash;one needed to when
one played ball for a living.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” she said, with a sigh of relief.
“It’s ever so much better. Oh, I don’t know what
would have happened if you had not been here!”</p>

<p>“Probably someone else would have done as
well,” laughed Joe. “Now about that carriage.”</p>

<p>Prince looked up as the youth approached, and
Joe saw a big bruise on the animal’s head.</p>

<p>“Too bad, old fellow, that I had to do that,”
spoke Joe, for he loved animals. “No other way,
though. I had to stop you.”</p>

<p>A look showed him that the horse was not
otherwise injured by the runaway, and another
look showed him that it would be impossible to
use the carriage. One of the wheels was broken.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pickle!” cried Joe. “A whole
bottle of ’em, for that matter. I can’t get her
home that way, and she can’t very well walk. I
can’t carry her, either. I guess the only thing to
do is to get her to the nearest house, and then go
for help&mdash;or ’phone, if they have a wire. I’m in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for the day’s adventure, I guess, but I can’t leave
her.”</p>

<p>Not that he wanted to, for the more he was in
the girl’s presence, the more often he looked into
her brown eyes, the more Joe felt that he was caring
very much for Miss Varley.</p>

<p>“Come, Matson!” he chided himself, “don’t
be an idiot!”</p>

<p>“Well?” she questioned, as he came back to
her.</p>

<p>“The carriage is broken,” he told her. “Do
you think you could walk to the nearest house?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure of it,” she replied, and now she
smiled, showing two rows of white, even teeth.
“I’m feeling ever so much better. But perhaps I
am keeping you,” and she hung back.</p>

<p>“Not at all. I’m glad to be able to help you. I
suppose I had better tie your horse.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>As Joe turned back to the grazing animal there
was the sound of a motor car out in the road. He
and the girl turned quickly, the same thought in
both their minds. Then a look of pleased surprise
came over Miss Varley’s face.</p>

<p>“Reggie! Reggie!” she called, waving her uninjured
hand at a young man in the car. “Reggie,
Prince bolted with me! Come over here!”</p>

<p>The machine was stopped with a screeching of
brakes, and the young fellow leaped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Mabel!” he cried, as he came sprinting
across the field. “Are you hurt? What happened?
Dad got anxious about you being gone so
long, and I said I’d look you up in my car. Are
you hurt, Mabel?”</p>

<p>Joe made a mental note that of all names he
liked best that of Mabel&mdash;especially when the
owner had brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Only a sprained wrist, Reggie. This gentleman
hit Prince with a stone and saved me from
going over the cliff.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he did!”</p>

<p>By this time the youth from the auto was beside
Joe and the girl. The two young men faced each
other. Joe gave a gasp of surprise that was
echoed by the other, for the youth confronting our
hero was none other than he who had accused Joe
of robbing that odd valise.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>A PARTING</small></h2>


<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;I’m awfully obliged to
you, of course, for saving my sister,” spoke the
newcomer&mdash;his name must be Reggie Varley, Joe
rightly decided. “Very much obliged, old man,
and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused, evidently quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>“You two act as though you had met before,”
said Miss Varley, with a smile. “Have you?”</p>

<p>“Once,” spoke Joe, drily. “I did not know
your brother’s name then.” He did not add that
he was glad to find that he was Mabel’s brother,
and not a more distant relation.</p>

<p>“How strange that you two should have met,”
went on Mabel Varley.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Joe, “and it was under rather
strange circumstances. It was while I was on my
way down here to join the ball team, and your
brother thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ahem!” exclaimed Reggie, with a meaning
look at Joe. “I&mdash;er&mdash;you’d better get in here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with me, Mabel, and let me get you home. Perhaps
this gentleman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“His name is Joe Matson,” spoke the girl,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mr. Matson will come home with&mdash;us,”
went on Reggie. Obviously it was an effort
to extend this invitation, but he could do no less
under the circumstances. Joe felt this and said
quickly:</p>

<p>“No, thank you, not this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I want papa and mamma to meet
you!” exclaimed Mabel, impulsively. “They’ll
want to thank you. Just think, Reggie, he saved
my life. Prince was headed for the cliff, and he
stopped him.”</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes as she gazed at
Joe.</p>

<p>“It was awfully good and clever of you, old
man,” said Reggie, rather affectedly, yet it was but
his way. “I’m sure I appreciate it very much.
And we’d like&mdash;my sister and I&mdash;we’d like awfully
to have you come on and take lunch with us.
I can put the horse up somewhere around here, I
dare say, and we can go on in my car.”</p>

<p>“The carriage is broken Reggie,” Mabel informed
him.</p>

<p>“Too bad. I’ll send Jake for it later. Will
you come?”</p>

<p>He seemed to wish to ignore, or at least postpone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the matter of the valise and his accusation.
Perhaps he felt how unjust it had been. Joe realized
Reggie’s position.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” spoke the young pitcher. “I
must be getting back to my hotel. I was just out
for a walk. Some other time, perhaps. If you
like, I’ll try and put the horse in some near-by barn
for you, and I’ll drop you a card, saying where it
is.”</p>

<p>“Will you really, old man?” asked Reggie,
eagerly. “It will be awfully decent of you, after&mdash;well,
I’d appreciate it very much. Then I could
get my sister home, and to a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Which I think would be a wise thing to do,”
remarked Joe. “Her wrist seems quite badly
sprained. I’ll attend to the horse. So now I’ll
say good-bye.”</p>

<p>He turned away. He and Reggie had not
shaken hands. In spite of the service Joe had
rendered he could not help feeling that young Varley
harbored some resentment against him.</p>

<p>“And if it’s her jewelry that is missing, with
his watch, and he tells her that he suspects me&mdash;I
wonder how she’ll feel afterward?” mused Joe.
“I wonder?”</p>

<p>Mabel held out her uninjured hand, and Joe
took it eagerly. The warm, soft pressure lingered
for some little time afterward in his hardened
palm&mdash;a palm roughened by baseball play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said, softly. “I can’t thank
you enough&mdash;now. You must come and get the
rest&mdash;later.”</p>

<p>“I will,” he said, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Here is my card&mdash;it has our address,” spoke
Reggie holding out a small, white square. “I
trust you will come&mdash;soon.”</p>

<p>“I shall try,” said Joe, with a peculiar look at
his accuser. “And I’ll drop you a card about the
horse.”</p>

<p>Reggie helped his sister into the auto, and they
drove off, Mabel waving a good-bye to Joe. The
latter stood for a minute in the field, looking at
the disappearing auto. Then he murmured, probably
to the horse, for there was no other sign of
life in sight:</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve gone and done it, Matson!
You’ve gone and done it!”</p>

<p>But Joe did not admit, even to himself, what he
had gone and done.</p>

<p>Prince seemed tractable enough after his recent
escapade, and made no objection to Joe leading
him out to the road. The young pitcher soon
came to a farmhouse, where, when he had explained
matters, the man readily agreed to stable
the animal until it should be called for.</p>

<p>And, as Joe Matson trudged back to the hotel
he said, more than once to himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve gone and done it, old man! You’ve
gone and done it!”</p>

<p>And a little later, as Joe thought of the look
on Reggie’s face when he recognized the youth he
had accused, our hero chuckled inwardly.</p>

<p>“He didn’t know what to do,” mused Joe. “I
sure had him buffaloed, as the boys say.”</p>

<p>Joe was welcomed by his fellow players on his
return to the hotel. It was nearly meal time, but
before going down to the dining room Joe wrote a
short note giving the name of the farmer where he
had left the horse.</p>

<p>“Let’s see now,” mused our hero. “To whom
shall I send it&mdash;to him&mdash;or&mdash;her.”</p>

<p>When he dropped the letter in the mail box the
envelope bore the superscription&mdash;“Miss Mabel
Varley.”</p>

<p>Practice was resumed Monday morning, and
Joe could note that there was a tightening up all
along the line. The orders from the manager and
his assistant came sharper and quicker.</p>

<p>“I want you boys to get right on edge!” exclaimed
Gregory. “We’ll play our opening game
in Pittston in two weeks now. We’ll cross bats
with Clevefield, last season’s pennant winners, and
we want to down them. I’m getting tired of being
in the ruck. I want to be on top of the heap.”</p>

<p>Joe, from his study of the baseball “dope,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
knew that Pittston had not made a very creditable
showing the last season.</p>

<p>The practice was sharp and snappy, and there
was a general improvement all along the line. Joe
was given several try-outs in the next few days, and
while he received no extravagant praise he knew
that his work pleased. Jake Collin still held his
enmity against Joe, and perhaps it was but natural.</p>

<p>Wet grounds, a day or so later, prevented practice,
and Joe took advantage of it to call on the
girl he had rescued. He found her home, her
wrist still bandaged, and she welcomed him warmly,
introducing him to her mother. Joe was made
to feel quite at home, and he realized that Reggie
had said nothing about the articles missing from
the valise&mdash;or, at least, had not mentioned the accusation
against Joe.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me how, and when, you met my
brother?” asked Mabel, after some general talk.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t he told you?” inquired Joe, with a
twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“No, he keeps putting it off.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps I’d better not tell,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Matson, I think you’re horrid! Is
there some reason I shouldn’t know?”</p>

<p>“Not as far as I am concerned. But I’d rather
your brother would tell.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m going to make him when he comes
home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe was rather glad Reggie was not there then.
For, in spite of everything, Joe knew there would
be a feeling of embarrassment on both sides.</p>

<p>“I have come to say good-bye,” he said to the
girl. “We leave for the North, soon, and the rest
of the season will be filled with traveling about.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you’re going,” she said, frankly.</p>

<p>“Are you?” he asked, softly. “Perhaps you
will allow me to write to you.”</p>

<p>“I’d be glad to have you,” she replied, warmly,
and she gave him a quick glance. “Perhaps I may
see you play sometime; I love baseball!”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad,” returned Joe, and, after a
while&mdash;rather a long while, to speak the truth&mdash;he
said good-bye.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE FIRST LEAGUE GAME</small></h2>


<p>“All aboard!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, everybody!”</p>

<p>“See you next Spring!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye!”</p>

<p>These were some of the calls heard at the
Montville station as the Pittston ball team left
their training grounds for the trip to their home
city, where the league season would start. Joe had
been South about three weeks, and had made a few
friends there. These waved a farewell to him, as
others did to other players, as the train pulled out.</p>

<p>Joe was not sure, but he thought he saw, amid
the throng, the face of a certain girl. At any rate
a white handkerchief was waved directly at him.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! Something doing!” joked Charlie
Hall, with whom Joe had struck up quite a friendship.
“Who’s the fair one, Joe?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see her face,” was the evasive answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now! That’s too thin! She’s evidently
taken a liking to you.”</p>

<p>“I hope she has!” exclaimed the young pitcher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and then blushed at his boldness. As the train
pulled past the station he had a full view of the
girl waving at him. She was Mabel Varley.
Charlie saw her also.</p>

<p>“My word!” he cried. “I congratulate you,
old man!” and he clapped Joe on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” came the retort, as Joe turned
his reddened face in the direction of the girl. And
he waved back, while some of the other players
laughed.</p>

<p>“Better be looking for someone to sign in Matson’s
place soon, Mack,” remarked John Holme,
the third baseman, with a chuckle. “He’s going
to trot in double harness if I know any of the
symptoms.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed the assistant manager.
“I’ll have to begin scouting again, I suppose.
Too bad, just as Joe is going to make good.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry,” advised our hero coolly.
“I’m going to play.”</p>

<p>The trip up was much more enjoyable than Joe
had found the one down, when he came alone. He
was beginning to know and like nearly all of his
team-mates&mdash;that is, all save Collin, and it was
due only to the latter’s surly disposition that Joe
could not be friendly with him.</p>

<p>“Think you’ll stay in this business long?” asked
Charlie of Joe as he sank into the seat beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I expect to make it my business&mdash;if I
can make good.”</p>

<p>“I think you will.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t intend to stay in this small league
forever,” went on Joe. “I’d like to get in a major
one.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t as easy as it seems,” said the other
college lad. “You know you’re sort of tied hand
and foot once you sign with a professional team.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Why, there is a sort of national agreement,
you know. No team in any league will take a player
from another team unless the manager of that
team gives the player his release. That is, you
can quit playing ball, of course; but, for the life of
you, you can’t get in any other professional team
until you are allowed to by the man with whom
you signed first.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, I’ve read about players being
given their release, and being sold or traded from
one team to another,” spoke Joe, “but I didn’t
think it was as close as that.”</p>

<p>“It is close,” said Hall, “a regular ‘trust.’
Modern professional baseball is really a trust.
There’s a gentleman’s agreement in regard to
players that’s never broken. I’m sorry, in a way,
that I didn’t stay an amateur. I, also, want to get
into a big league, but the worst of it is that if you
show up well in a small league, and prove a drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
card, the manager won’t release you. And until
he does no other manager would hire you.
Though, of course, the double A leagues can draft
anyone they like.”</p>

<p>Joe whistled softly.</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t going to be so easy to get into
another league as I thought,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not unless something happens,” replied his
team-mate. “Of course, if another manager
wanted you badly enough he would pay the price,
and buy you from this club. High prices have been
paid, too. There’s Marquard&mdash;the Giants gave
ten thousand dollars to have him play for them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard about that,” spoke Joe, “but I
supposed it was mostly talk.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal more than talk,” asserted
Charlie. “Though it’s a great advertisement for
a man. Think of being worth ten thousand dollars
more than your salary!”</p>

<p>“And he didn’t get the ten,” commented Joe.</p>

<p>“No. That’s the worst of it. We’re the slaves
of baseball, in a way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I don’t mind being that kind of a
slave,” said Joe, laughingly.</p>

<p>He lay back in his seat as the train whirled on,
and before him, as he closed his eyes, he could see
a girl’s face&mdash;the face of Mabel Varley.</p>

<p>“I wonder if her brother told her?” mused the
young pitcher. “If he did she may think just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
he did&mdash;that I had a hand in looting that valise.
Oh, pshaw! I’m not going to think about it. And
yet I wish the mystery was cleared up&mdash;I sure
do!”</p>

<p>The training had done all the players good.
They were right “on edge” and eager to get into
the fray. Not a little horse-play was indulged in
on the way North. The team had a car to itself,
and so felt more freedom than otherwise would
have been the case.</p>

<p>Terry Blake, the little “mascot” of the nine,
was a great favorite, and he and Joe soon became
fast friends.</p>

<p>Terry liked to play tricks on the men who made
so much of him, and late that first afternoon he
stole up behind Jake Collin, who had fallen asleep,
and tickled his face with a bit of paper. At first
the pitcher seemed to think it was a troublesome
fly, and his half-awake endeavors to get rid of it
amused Terry and some others who were watching.</p>

<p>Then, as the tickling was persisted in, Collin
awoke with a start. He had the name of waking
up cross and ugly, and this time was no exception.
As he started up he caught sight of the little mascot,
and understood what had been going on.</p>

<p>“You brat!” he cried, leaping out into the aisle.
Terry fled, with frightened face, and Collin ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
after him. “I’ll punch you for that!” cried the
pitcher.</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t you take a joke?” someone asked
him, but Collin paid no heed. He raced after poor
little Terry, who had meant no harm, and the
mascot might have come to grief had not Joe
stepped out into the aisle of the car and confronted
Collin.</p>

<p>“Let me past! Let me get at him!” stormed
the man.</p>

<p>“No, not now,” was Joe’s quiet answer.</p>

<p>“Out of my way, you whipper-snapper, or
I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He drew back his arm, his fist clenched, but Joe
never quailed. He looked Collin straight in the
eyes, and the man’s arm went down. Joe was
smaller than he, but the young pitcher was no
weakling.</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Collin,” said Jimmie Mack, quietly.
“The boy only meant it for a joke.”</p>

<p>Collin did not answer. But as he turned aside
to go back to his seat he gave Joe a black look.
There was an under-current of unpleasant feeling
over the incident during the remainder of the trip.</p>

<p>Little Terry stole up to Joe, when the players
came back from the dining-car, and, slipped his
small hand into that of the pitcher.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I like you,” he said, softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you?” asked Joe with smile. “I’m glad
of that, Terry.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll always see that you have the bat you
want when you want it,” went on the little mascot.
Poor little chap, he was an orphan, and Gus Harrison,
the big centre fielder, had practically adopted
him. Then he was made the official mascot, and
while perhaps the constant association with the
ball players was not altogether good for the small
lad, still he might have been worse off.</p>

<p>Pittston was reached in due season, no happenings
worth chronicling taking place on the way.
Joe was eager to see what sort of a ball field the
team owned, and he was not disappointed when,
early the morning after his arrival, he and the
others went out to it for practice.</p>

<p>It was far from being the New York Polo
Grounds, nor was the field equal to the one at
Yale, but Joe had learned to take matters as they
came, and he never forgot that he was only with
a minor league.</p>

<p>“Time enough to look for grounds laid out
with a rule and compass when I get into a major
league,” he told himself. “That is, if I can get
my release.”</p>

<p>Joe found some letters from home awaiting him
at the hotel where the team had its official home.
But, before he answered them he wrote to Mabel.
I wonder if we ought to blame him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The more Joe saw of his team-mates the more
he liked them&mdash;save Collin, and that was no fault
of the young pitcher. He found Pittston a pleasant
place, and the citizens ardent “fans.” They
thought their team was about as good as any in
that section, and, though it had not captured the
pennant, there were hopes that it would come to
Pittston that season.</p>

<p>“They’re good rooters!” exclaimed Jimmie
Mack. “I will say that for this Pittston bunch.
They may not be such a muchness otherwise, but
they’re good rooters, and it’s a pleasure to play
ball here. They warm you up, and make you do
your best.”</p>

<p>Joe was glad to hear this.</p>

<p>The new grounds were a little strange to him,
at first, but he soon became used to them after one
or two days’ practice. Nearly all the other players,
of course, were more at home.</p>

<p>“And now, boys,” said Manager Gregory,
when practice had closed one day. “I want you
to do your prettiest to-morrow. I’ve got a good
team&mdash;I know it. Some of you are new to me,
but I’ve heard about you, and I’m banking on
your making good. I want you to wallop Clevefield
to-morrow. I want every man to do his
best, and don’t want any hard feelings if I play
one man instead of another. I have reasons for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
it. Now that’s my last word to you. I want you
to win.”</p>

<p>There was a little nervous feeling among the
players as the time for the first league game drew
near. A number of the men had been bought
from other clubs. There was one former Clevefield
player on the Pittston team, and also one
from the pennant club of a previous year.</p>

<p>That night Joe spent some time studying the
batting averages of the opposing team, and also
he read as much of their history as he could get
hold of. He wanted to know the characteristics
of the various batters if he should be fortunate
enough to face them from the pitching mound.</p>

<p>There was the blare of a band, roars of cheers,
and much excitement. The official opening of the
league season was always an event in Pittston, as
it is in most large cities. The team left their hotel
in a body, going to the grounds in a large ’bus,
which was decorated with flags. A mounted police
escort had been provided, and a large throng,
mostly boys, marched to the grounds, accompanying
the players.</p>

<p>There another demonstration took place as the
home team paraded over the diamond, and greeted
their opponents, who were already on hand, an
ovation having also been accorded to them.</p>

<p>The band played again, there were more cheers
and encouraging calls, and then the Mayor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
city stepped forward to throw the first ball. Clevefield
was to bat first, the home team, in league
games, always coming up last.</p>

<p>The initial ball, of course, was only a matter of
form, and the batter only pretended to strike at it.</p>

<p>Then came the announcement all were waiting
for; the naming of the Pittston battery.</p>

<p>“For Clevefield,” announced the umpire, “McGuinness
and Sullivan. For Pittston, Matson and
Nelson.”</p>

<p>Joe had been picked to open the battle, and
Nelson, who was the regular catcher, except when
Gregory took a hand, would back him up. Joe’s
ears rang as he walked to the mound.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” droned the umpire.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>BITTERNESS</small></h2>


<p>Joe glanced over to where Gregory sat on the
bench, from which he would engineer this first
game of the season. The manager caught the eye
of the young pitcher, and something in Joe’s manner
must have told the veteran that his latest recruit
was nervous. He signalled to Joe to try a
few practice balls, and our hero nodded comprehensively.</p>

<p>The batter stepped back from the plate, and
Joe thought he detected a smile of derision at
his own newness, and perhaps rawness.</p>

<p>“But I’ll show him!” whispered Joe fiercely
to himself, as he clinched his teeth and stung in the
ball. It landed in the mitt of the catcher with a
resounding thud.</p>

<p>“That’s the boy!” called Gregory to him.
“You’ll do, old man. Sting in another.”</p>

<p>Joe threw with all his force, but there was a
sickening fear in his heart that he was not keeping
good control over the ball. Nelson signalled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
him to hold his curves in a little more, and Joe
nodded to show he understood.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” drawled the umpire again, and
the batter took his place at the plate.</p>

<p>Joe looked at the man, and reviewing the baseball
“dope” he recalled that the player batted
well over .300, and was regarded as the despair
of many pitchers.</p>

<p>“If I could only strike him out!” thought Joe.</p>

<p>His first ball went a little wild. He realized
that it was going to be a poor one as soon as it
left his hand, but he could not for the life of him
recover in time.</p>

<p>“Ball one!” yelled the umpire.</p>

<p>“That’s the way!”</p>

<p>“Make him give you what you want!”</p>

<p>“Wait for a pretty one!”</p>

<p>“That’s their ten thousand dollar college
pitcher! Back to the bench for his!”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the remarks, sarcastic
and otherwise, that greeted Joe’s first performance.
He felt the hot blood rush to his face,
and then, as he stepped forward to receive the ball
which the catcher tossed back to him, he tried to
master his feelings. The catcher shook his head in
a certain way, to signal to Joe to be on his guard.
Joe looked over at Gregory, who did not glance
at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll do better this time!” whispered Joe,
fiercely.</p>

<p>He deliberated a moment before hurling in the
next ball.</p>

<p>“Here goes a home run! Clout it over the
fence, Pike!” called an enthusiastic “fan” in a
shrill voice and the crowd laughed.</p>

<p>“Not if I know it!” muttered Joe.</p>

<p>The ball clipped the corner of the plate cleanly,
and the batter, who had made a half motion to
hit at it, refrained.</p>

<p>“Strike one!” yelled the umpire, throwing up
his arm.</p>

<p>“That’s the way, Matson!”</p>

<p>“Two more like that and he’s a dead one!”</p>

<p>Joe caught the signal for a drop, but shook his
head. He was going to try another out. Again
his catcher signalled for a drop, but Joe was, perhaps,
a trifle obstinate. He felt that he had been
successful once with an out, and he was going to
do it again. The catcher finally nodded in agreement,
though reluctantly.</p>

<p>Joe shot in a fast one, and he knew that he had
the ball under perfect control. Perhaps he was as
disappointed as any of the home players when
there came a resounding crack, and the white
sphere sailed aloft, and well out over centre field.</p>

<p>“That’s the way, Pike! Two bags anyhow!”</p>

<p>But the redoubtable Pike was to have no such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
good fortune, for the centre fielder, after a heart-breaking
run, got under the fly and caught it,
winning much applause from the crowd for his
plucky effort.</p>

<p>“One down!” called Gregory, cheerfully.
“Only two more, Joe.”</p>

<p>Joe wished that he had struck out his man, but
it was some consolation to know that he was being
supported by good fielding.</p>

<p>The next man up had a ball and a strike called
on him, and Joe was a bit puzzled as to just what
to offer. He decided on a swift in, and thought it
was going to make good, but the batter was a
crafty veteran, and managed to connect with the
ball. He sent a swift liner which the shortstop
gathered in, however, and there was another
added to the list of outs.</p>

<p>“One more and that’ll be about all!” called the
Pittston catcher. Joe threw the ball over to first
for a little practice, while the next batter was picking
out his stick, and then came another try.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to strike him out!” decided the young
pitcher. “I’ve got to make good!”</p>

<p>His heart was fluttering, and his nerves were
not as calm as they ought to have been. He
stooped over and made a pretence of tying his
shoe-lace. When he straightened up he had, in a
measure, gained a mastery of himself. He felt
cool and collected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>In went the ball with certain aim, and Joe knew
that it was just what he had intended it should be.</p>

<p>“Strike!” called the umpire, though the batter
had not moved. There was some laughter from
the grandstand, and the batter tapped the plate
nervously. Joe smiled.</p>

<p>“Good work!” called Gregory from the bench.</p>

<p>Again the ball went sailing in, but this time Joe’s
luck played him a shabby trick, or perhaps the
umpire was not watching closely. Certainly Joe
thought it a strike, but “ball” was called. Joe
sent in the next one so quickly that the batter was
scarcely prepared for it. But it was perfectly
legitimate and the umpire howled:</p>

<p>“Strike two!”</p>

<p>“That’s the boy!”</p>

<p>“Good work!”</p>

<p>“Another like that now, Joe!”</p>

<p>Thus cried the throng. Gregory looked pleased.</p>

<p>“I guess Mack didn’t make any mistake picking
him up,” he said.</p>

<p>The batter knocked a little foul next, that the
catcher tried in vain to get. And then, when he
faced Joe again, our hero sent in such a puzzling
drop that the man was deceived and struck out.</p>

<p>“That’s the boy!”</p>

<p>“What do you think of our ten thousand dollar
college pitcher now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on, Clevefield! He’s got some more
just like that!”</p>

<p>The home team and its supporters were jubilant,
and Joe felt a sense of elation as he walked
in to the bench.</p>

<p>“Now see what my opponent can do,” he murmured.</p>

<p>McGuinness was an old time pitcher, nothing
very remarkable, but one any small club would be
glad to get. He had the “number” of most of
the Pittston players, and served them balls and
strikes in such order that though two little pop
flies were knocked no one made a run. The result
of the first inning was a zero for each team.</p>

<p>“Now Joe, be a little more careful, and I think
you can get three good ones,” said Gregory, as
his team again took the field.</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” replied Joe, earnestly.</p>

<p>He got two men, but not the third, who knocked
a clean two-bagger, amid enthusiastic howls from
admiring “fans.”</p>

<p>This two-base hit seemed to spell Joe’s undoing,
for the next man duplicated and the first run was
scored. There were two out, and it looked as
though Clevefield had struck a winning streak, for
the next man knocked what looked to be good for
single. But Bob Newton, the right fielder, caught
it, and the side was retired with one run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Pittston tried hard to score, but the crafty
pitcher, aided by effective fielding, shut them out,
and another zero was their portion on the score
board.</p>

<p>“Joe, we’ve got to get ’em!” exclaimed Gregory,
earnestly.</p>

<p>“I’ll try!” was the sturdy answer.</p>

<p>It was heart-breaking, though, when the first
man up singled, and then came a hit and run play.
Joe was not the only player on the Pittston team
who rather lost his head that inning. For, though
Joe was hit badly, others made errors, and the net
result was that Clevefield had four runs to add to
the one, while Pittston had none.</p>

<p>They managed, however, to get two in the following
inning, more by good luck than good management,
and the game began to look, as Jimmie
Mack said, as though the other team had it in the
“refrigerator.”</p>

<p>How it happened Joe never knew, but he
seemed to go to pieces. Probably it was all a case
of nerves, and the realization that this game meant
more to him than any college contest.</p>

<p>However that may be, the result was that Joe
was effectively hit the next inning, and when it
was over, and three more runs had come in, Gregory
said sharply:</p>

<p>“Collin, you’ll pitch now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>It meant that Joe had been “knocked out of
the box.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get this game!” explained the
manager, not unkindly. But Joe felt, with bitterness
in his heart, that he had failed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>OLD POP CONSOLES</small></h2>


<p>Collin flashed a look of mingled scorn and
triumph on Joe as he walked past him. It needed
only this to make our hero feel that he had stood
about all he could, and he turned away, and tried
to get rid of a lump in his throat.</p>

<p>None of the other players seemed to notice him.
Probably it was an old story to them. Competition
was too fierce&mdash;it was a matter of making a
living on their part&mdash;every man was for himself,
in a certain sense. They had seen young players
come and old players go. It was only a question
of time when they themselves would go&mdash;go never
to come back into baseball again. They might eke
out a livelihood as a scout or as a ground-keeper
in some big league. It was a fight for the survival
of the fittest, and Joe’s seeming failure brought no
apparent sympathy.</p>

<p>Understand me, I am not speaking against
organized baseball. It is a grand thing, and one
of the cleanest sports in the world. But what I
am trying to point out is that it is a business, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from a business standpoint everyone in it must do
his best for himself. Each man, in a sense, is concerned
only with his own success. Nor do I mean
that this precludes a love of the club, and good
team work. Far from it.</p>

<p>Nor were Joe’s feelings made any the less
poignant by the fact that Collin did some wonderful
pitching. He needed to in order to pull the
home team out of the hole into which it had
slipped&mdash;and not altogether through Joe’s weakness,
either.</p>

<p>Perhaps the other players braced up when they
saw the veteran Collin in the box. Perhaps he
even pitched better than usual because he had, in
a sense, been humiliated by Joe’s preference over
himself. At any rate, whatever the reason, the
answer was found in the fact that Pittston began
to wake up.</p>

<p>Collin held the other team hitless for one
inning, and the rest of the game, ordinary in a
sense, saw Pittston march on to victory&mdash;a small
enough victory&mdash;by a margin of two runs, but that
was enough. For victory had come out of almost
sure defeat.</p>

<p>Poor Joe sat on the bench and brooded. For
a time no one seemed to take any notice of him,
and then Gregory, good general that he was,
turned to the new recruit and said:</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind a little thing like that, Joe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
I have to do the best as I see it. This is business,
you know. Why, I’d have pulled Collin out, or
Tooley, just as quick.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” returned Joe, thickly.</p>

<p>But the knowledge did not add to his comfort,
though he tried to make it do so.</p>

<p>But I am getting a little ahead of my story.</p>

<p>The game was almost over, and it was practically
won by Pittston, when a voice spoke back of
where Joe sat on the players’ bench. It was a
husky, uncertain, hesitating sort of voice and it
said, in the ear of the young pitcher:</p>

<p>“Never mind, my lad. Ten years from now,
when you’re in a big league, you’ll forget all about
this. It’ll do you good, anyhow, for it’ll make you
work harder, and hard work makes a good ball
player out of a middle-class one. Brace up. I
know what I’m talking about!”</p>

<p>Joe hesitated a moment before turning. Somehow
he had a vague feeling that he had heard that
voice before, and under strange circumstances. He
wanted to see if he could place it before looking
at the speaker.</p>

<p>But it was baffling, and Joe turned quickly. He
started as he saw standing behind him, attired
rather more neatly than when last he had confronted
our hero&mdash;the tramp whom he had saved
from the freight train.</p>

<p>On his part the other looked sharply at Joe for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
a moment. Over his face passed shadows of
memory, and then the light came. He recognized
Joe, and with a note of gladness in his husky voice&mdash;husky
from much shouting on the ball field, and
from a reckless life&mdash;he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why it’s the boy! It’s the boy who pulled me
off the track! It’s the boy!”</p>

<p>“Of course!” exclaimed Joe. Impulsively he
held out his hand.</p>

<p>A shout arose as one of the Pittston players
brought in the winning run, but Joe paid no heed.
He was staring at old Pop Dutton.</p>

<p>The other player&mdash;the “has-been”&mdash;looked at
Joe’s extended hand a moment as if in doubt.
Then he glanced over the field, and listened to the
glad cries. He seemed to straighten up, and his
nostrils widened as he sniffed in the odors of the
crushed green grass. It was as though a broken-down
horse had heard from afar the battle-riot
in which he never again would take part.</p>

<p>Back came the blood-shot eyes to Joe’s still
extended hand.</p>

<p>“Do you&mdash;do you mean it?” faltered the old
ball player.</p>

<p>“Mean it? Mean what?” asked Joe, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Are you going to shake hands with me&mdash;with
a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not finish his obvious sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>The other did not need to answer, for at that
moment Gregory came up. He started at the
sight of Dutton, and said sharply:</p>

<p>“How did you get in here? What are you
doing here. Didn’t I tell you to keep away?”</p>

<p>“I paid my way in&mdash;<em>Mister</em> Gregory!” was the
sarcastic answer. “I still have the price.”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t care for your money. What
are you doing here? The bleachers for yours!”</p>

<p>“He came&mdash;I think he came to see me,” spoke
Joe, softly, and he reached for the other’s reluctant
hand. “I have met him before.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Gregory, and there was a queer note
in his voice. “I guess we’ve all met him before,
and none of us are the better for it. You probably
don’t know him as well as the rest of us, Joe.”</p>

<p>“He&mdash;he saved my life,” faltered the unfortunate
old ball player.</p>

<p>“In a way that was a pity,” returned Gregory,
coolly&mdash;cuttingly, Joe thought, “for you’re no
good to yourself, Dutton, nor to anyone else, as
near as I can make out. I told you I didn’t want
you hanging around my grounds, and I don’t.
Now be off! If I find you here again I’ll hand you
over to the police!”</p>

<p>Joe expected an outburst from Dutton, but the
man’s spirit was evidently broken. For an instant&mdash;just
for an instant&mdash;he straightened up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
looked full at Gregory. Then he seemed to shrink
in his clothes and turned to shuffle away.</p>

<p>“All&mdash;all right,” he mumbled. “I’ll keep
away. But you’ve got one fine little pitcher in that
boy, and I didn’t want to see him lose his nerve
and get discouraged&mdash;as I often did. That&mdash;that’s
why I spoke to him.”</p>

<p>Poor Joe felt that he had rather made a mess
of it in speaking to Dutton, but, he said afterward,
he would have done the same thing over
again.</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry about Matson,” said the
manager, with a sneer. “I’ll look after Joe&mdash;I’ll
see that he doesn’t lose his nerve&mdash;or get discouraged.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I hope you do,” said the old player, and
then, with uncertain gait, he walked off as the
victorious Pittston players swarmed in. The game
was over.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE QUEER VALISE</small></h2>


<p>“Matson, I hope you didn’t misunderstand
me,” remarked the manager as he walked beside
Joe to the dressing rooms. “I mean in regard to
that Dutton. He’s an intolerable nuisance, and I
didn’t want you to get mixed up with him. Perhaps
I spoke stronger than I should, but I’m exasperated
with him. I’ve tried&mdash;and so have lots
of us&mdash;to get him back on the right road again, but
I’m afraid he’s hopeless.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” burst out the young pitcher.
“Yes, I thought you were a little severe with him.”</p>

<p>“I have to be. I don’t want him hanging around
here. I haven’t seen him for some time. He
drifts all about&mdash;beating his way like a tramp, I
guess, though he’s better dressed now than in a
long while. What’s that he said about you saving
his life?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I did, in a way,” and Joe told
of the freight train episode. “But that happened
a long distance from here,” he added. “I was
surprised to turn around and see him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Pop travels all over. You’ve probably
heard about him. In his day there wasn’t a better
pitcher in any league. But he got careless&mdash;that,
bad companions and dissipation spelled ruin for
him. He’s down and out now, and I’m sure he can
never come back. He lives off what he can borrow
or beg from those who used to be his friends.
Steer clear of him&mdash;that’s my advice.”</p>

<p>Joe did not respond and after a moment Gregory
went on with:</p>

<p>“And you mustn’t mind, Joe, being taken out of
to-day’s game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t&mdash;after the first.”</p>

<p>“It was for your own good, as well as for the
good of the team,” proceeded the manager. “If
I hadn’t taken you out you might have gone to
pieces, and the crowd would have said mean things
that are hard to forget. And I want you to pitch
for us to-morrow, Joe.”</p>

<p>“You do!” cried the delighted young pitcher,
all his bitterness forgotten now. “I thought maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused in confusion.</p>

<p>“Just because you got a little off to-day, did
you imagine I was willing to give you your release?”
asked Gregory, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;something like that,” confessed Joe.</p>

<p>The manager laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t take it so seriously,” he advised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
“You’ve got lots to learn yet about professional
baseball, and I want you to learn it right.”</p>

<p>Joe felt a sense of gratitude, and when he
reached the hotel that afternoon, he took a refreshing
shower bath, attired himself in his “glad
rags,” and bought a ticket to the theatre.</p>

<p>Then, before supper, he sat down to write
home, enclosing some of his salary to be put in a
savings bank at Riverside. Joe also wrote a glowing
account of the game, even though his part in
it was rather negligible. He also wrote to&mdash; But
there! I shouldn’t tell secrets that way. It’s taking
too much of an advantage over a fellow.</p>

<p>There was an air of elation about the hotel
where the players lived, and on all sides were
heard congratulations. The evening papers had
big headlines with the victory of the home team
displayed prominently. Collin’s picture was there,
and how much Joe wished that his own was so
displayed only he himself knew.</p>

<p>Clevefield played four games with Pittston, and
they broke even&mdash;each side winning two. Joe was
given another chance to pitch, and was mainly
responsible for winning the second game for his
team.</p>

<p>Joe was fast becoming accustomed to his new
life. Of course there was always something different
coming up&mdash;some new problem to be met.
But he got in the way of solving them. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
different from his life at boarding school, and different
from his terms at Yale. He missed the
pleasant, youthful comradeship of both places, but
he found, as he grew to know them better, some
sterling men in his own team, and in those of the
opposing clubs.</p>

<p>But with all that, at times, Joe felt rather lonesome.
Of course the days were busy ones, either
at practice or in play. But his nights were his own,
and often he had no one with whom he cared to
go out.</p>

<p>He and Charlie Hall grew more and more
friendly, but it was not a companionship of long
enough standing to make it the kind Joe really
cared for.</p>

<p>He had much pleasure in writing home, and to
Mabel, who in turn, sent interesting letters of her
life in the South. One letter in particular made
Joe rather eager.</p>

<p>“My brother and I are coming North on a
combined business and pleasure trip,” she wrote,
“and we may see your team play. We expect to
be in Newkirk on the twentieth.”</p>

<p>Joe dropped everything to look eagerly at the
official schedule.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the luck!” he cried. “We play
in Newkirk that date. I wonder if she knew it?
I wonder&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>Then for days Joe almost prayed that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
would be no rainy days&mdash;no upsetting of the
schedule that would necessitate double-headers, or
anything that would interfere with playing at Newkirk
on the date mentioned. That city, as he
found by looking at a map, was on a direct railroad
line from Goldsboro.</p>

<p>“I hope nothing slips up!” murmured the
young pitcher. From then on he lived in a sort
of rosy glow.</p>

<p>The ball season of the Central League was well
under way now. A number of games had been
played, necessitating travel from one city to
another. Some of the journeys Joe liked, and
some were tiresome. He met all sorts and conditions
of men and was growing to be able to
take things as he found them.</p>

<p>Joe worked hard, and he took a defeat more
to heart than did any of the others. It seemed to
be all in the day’s work with them. With Joe it
was a little more. Not that any of the players
were careless, though. They were more sophisticated,
rather.</p>

<p>The third week of the season, then, found Pittston
third in line for pennant honors, and when the
loss of a contest to Buffington had set them at the
end of the first division there were some rather
glum-looking faces seen in the hotel corridor.</p>

<p>“Boys, we’ve got to take a brace!” exclaimed
Gregory, and the manner in which he said it told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his men that he meant it. Joe went to bed that
night wildly resolving to do all sorts of impossible
things, so it is no wonder he dreamed that he
pitched a no-hit no-run game, and was carried in
triumph around the diamond on the shoulders of
his enthusiastic comrades.</p>

<p>I shall not weary you with an account of the
ordinary games. Just so many had to be played
in a certain order to fulfill the league conditions.
Some of the contests were brilliant affairs, and
others dragged themselves out wearily.</p>

<p>Joe had his share in the good and bad, but,
through it all, he was gradually acquiring a good
working knowledge of professional baseball. He
was getting better control of his curves, and he
was getting up speed so that it was noticeable.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to get Nelson a mitt with a deeper
pit in it if you keep on,” said Gregory with a
laugh, after one exciting contest when Joe had
fairly “pitched his head off,” and the game had
been won for Pittston by a narrow margin.</p>

<p>Gradually Joe’s team crept up until it was
second, with Clevefield still at the head.</p>

<p>“And our next game is with Newkirk!” exulted
Joe one morning as they took the train for that
place. They were strictly on schedule, and Joe
was eager, for more reasons than one, to reach
the city where he hoped a certain girl might be.</p>

<p>“If we win, and Clevefield loses to-morrow,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
spoke Charlie Hall, as he dropped into a seat beside
Joe, “we’ll be on top of the heap.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;if!” exclaimed the young pitcher. “But
I’m going to do my best, Charlie!”</p>

<p>“The same here!”</p>

<p>It was raining when the team arrived in Newkirk,
and the weather was matched by the glum
faces of the players.</p>

<p>“No game to-morrow, very likely,” said
Charlie, in disappointed tones. “Unless they have
rubber grounds here.”</p>

<p>“No such luck,” returned Joe.</p>

<p>As he walked with the others to the desk to
register he saw, amid a pile of luggage, a certain
peculiar valise. He knew it instantly.</p>

<p>“Reggie Varley’s!” he exclaimed to himself.
“There never was another bag like that. And it
has his initials on it. Reggie Varley is here&mdash;at
this hotel, and&mdash;and&mdash;she&mdash;must be here too.
Let it rain!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>MABEL</small></h2>


<p>Joe Matson stood spell-bound for a second or
so, staring at the valise which had such an interest
for him in two ways. It meant the presence at the
hotel of the girl who had awakened such a new
feeling within him, and also it recalled the unpleasant
occasion when he had been accused of rifling it.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Matson?” asked Gus
Harrison, the big centre fielder, who stood directly
behind the young pitcher, waiting to register.
“Have you forgotten your name?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;oh, no!” exclaimed our hero, coming to
himself with a start. “I&mdash;er&mdash;I was just thinking
of something.”</p>

<p>“I should imagine so,” commented Harrison.
“Get a move on. I want to go to my room and
tog up. I’ve got a date with a friend.”</p>

<p>As Joe turned away from the desk, after registering,
he could not refrain from glancing at the
odd valise. He half expected to see Reggie Varley
standing beside it, but there was no sign of
Mabel’s brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quite a coincidence that she should be stopping
at this hotel,” thought Joe, for a quick glance
at the names on the register, ahead of those of the
ball team, had shown Joe that Miss Varley’s was
among them. “Quite a coincidence,” Joe mused
on. “I wonder if she came here because she
knew this was where the team always stops? Oh,
of course not. I’m getting looney, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Then, as he looked at the valise again another
thought came to him.</p>

<p>“I do wish there was some way of proving to
young Varley that I didn’t take the stuff out of
it,” reasoned Joe. “But I don’t see how I can
prove that I didn’t. It’s harder to prove a negative
than it is a positive, they say. Maybe he has
found his stuff by this time; I must ask him if I
get a chance. And yet I don’t like to bring it up
again, especially as she’s here. She doesn’t know
of it yet, that’s evident, or she’d have said something.
I mean Reggie hasn’t told her that he
once suspected me.”</p>

<p>Joe went to his room, and made a much more
careful toilet than usual. So much so that Charlie
Hall inquired rather sarcastically:</p>

<p>“Who’s the lady, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Lady? What do you mean?” responded Joe,
with simulated innocence.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, that’s too thin!” laughed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
shortstop. “Why all this gorgeousness? And a
new tie! Upon my word! You are going it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out!” growled Joe, a bit incensed.</p>

<p>But, all the while, he was wondering how and
when he would meet Mabel. Would it be proper
for him to send her his card? Or would she know
that the ball team had arrived, and send word to
Joe that he could see her? How were such things
managed anyhow?</p>

<p>Joe wished there was some one whom he could
ask, but he shrank from taking into his confidence
any of the members of the team.</p>

<p>“I’ll just wait and see what turns up,” he said.</p>

<p>Fate was kind to him, however.</p>

<p>Most of the ball players had gone in to dinner,
discussing, meanwhile, the weather probabilities.
There was a dreary drizzle outside, and the prospects
for a fair day to follow were remote indeed.
It meant almost certainly that there would be no
game, and this was a disappointment to all. The
Pittston team was on edge for the contest, for
they wanted their chance to get to the top of the
league.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it’s just as well,” confided Gregory
to Jimmie Mack. “It’ll give the boys a chance
to rest up, and they’ve been going the pace pretty
hard lately. I do hope we win, though.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” exclaimed Jimmie earnestly.</p>

<p>As Joe came down from his apartment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
crossed the foyer into the dining room, he turned
around a pillar and came face to face with Reggie
Varley&mdash;and his sister.</p>

<p>They both started at the sight of the young
pitcher, and Mabel blushed. Joe did the same, for
that matter.</p>

<p>“Oh, why how do you do!” the girl exclaimed
graciously, holding out her hand. “I’m awfully
glad to see you again! So you are here with your
team? Oh, I do hope you’ll win! Too bad it’s
raining; isn’t it? Reggie, you must take me to the
game! You remember Mr. Matson, of course!”</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly, as though to cover some embarrassment,
and, for a few seconds, Joe had no
chance to say anything, save incoherent murmurs,
which, possibly, was proper under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember him,” said Reggie, but
there was not much cordiality in his tone or manner.
“Certainly I remember him. Glad to meet
you again, old man. We haven’t forgotten what
you did for sis. Awfully good of you.”</p>

<p>Joe rather resented this tone, but perhaps
Reggie could not help it. And the young pitcher
wondered whether there was any significance in the
way Reggie “remembered.”</p>

<p>Young Varley glanced over toward where his
odd valise had been placed, in a sort of checking
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said to his sister and Joe. “I
must have my luggage sent up. I quite forgot
about it.”</p>

<p>“Then there isn’t any jewelry in it this time,”
spoke Joe significantly, and under the impulse of
the moment. A second later he regretted it.</p>

<p>“No, of course not. Oh, I see!” exclaimed
Reggie, and his face turned red. “I’ll be back
in a moment,” he added as he hurried off.</p>

<p>Mabel glanced from her brother to Joe. She
saw that there was something between them of
which she knew nothing, but she had the tact to
ignore it&mdash;at least for the present.</p>

<p>“Have you dined?” she asked Joe. “If you
haven’t there’s a vacant seat at our table, and I’m
sure Reggie and I would be glad to have you sit
with us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether he would or not,” said
Joe, feeling that, as his part in the story of the
valise and the missing jewelry would have to come
out sometime, now was as good as any.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what do you mean?” asked Mabel in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t he told you?” demanded Joe.</p>

<p>“Told me? Told me what? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I mean about his watch and some of your
jewelry being taken.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, some time ago. You mean when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was up North. Wasn’t it too bad! And my
lovely beads were in his valise. But how did you
know of it?”</p>

<p>“Because,” blurted out Joe, “your brother accused
me of taking them!”</p>

<p>Mabel started back.</p>

<p>“No!” she cried. “Never! He couldn’t have
done that!”</p>

<p>“But he did, and I’d give a lot to be able to
prove that I had no hand in the looting!” Joe
spoke, half jokingly.</p>

<p>“How silly!” exclaimed the girl. “The idea!
How did it happen?”</p>

<p>Joe explained briefly, amid rather excited ejaculations
from Mabel, and had just concluded when
Reggie came back. He caught enough of the conversation
to understand what it was about, and as
his sister looked oddly at him, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, I say now, Matson! I was hoping that
wouldn’t get out. I suppose I made rather a fool
of myself&mdash;talking to you the way I did, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, I resented it somewhat at the time,”
replied Joe, slowly, “but I know how you must
have felt.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, I never have had a trace of the
stuff. I was hoping sis, here, wouldn’t know how
I accused you&mdash;especially after the plucky way you
saved her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought it best to tell,” said the young
pitcher, quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, as you like,” and Reggie shrugged
his shoulders. “It was certainly a queer go.”</p>

<p>“And I’m living in hope,” went on Joe, “that
some day I’ll be able to prove that I had no hand
in the matter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course you didn’t!” cried Mabel, impulsively.
“It’s silly of you, Reggie, to think
such a thing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it&mdash;now!”</p>

<p>But in spite of this denial Joe could not help
feeling that perhaps, after all, Reggie Varley still
had an undefined suspicion against him.</p>

<p>“I say!” exclaimed Joe’s one-time accuser,
“won’t you dine with us? We have a nice waiter
at our table&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I had already asked him,” broke in Mabel.</p>

<p>“Then that’s all right. I say, Matson, can’t
you take my sister in? I’ve just had a ’phone
message about some of dad’s business that brought
me up here. I’ve got to go see a man, and if you’ll
take Mabel in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted.”</p>

<p>“How long will you be, Reggie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not long, Sis. But if I see Jenkinson to-night
it will save us time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. But if I let you off now you’ll
have to take me to the ball game to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will&mdash;if it doesn’t rain.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be back in time for the theatre?”</p>

<p>“Surely. I’ll run along now. It’s awfully good
of you, Matson, to take&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not at all!” interrupted Joe. The pleasure
was all his, he felt.</p>

<p>He and Mabel went into the hotel dining room,
and Joe’s team-mates glanced curiously at him
from where they sat. But none of them made any
remarks.</p>

<p>“It was dreadful of Reggie, to accuse you that
way,” the girl murmured, when they were seated.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was flustered, and perhaps it was
natural,” said Joe. “I did sit near the valise,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>They talked over the matter at some length,
and then the conversation drifted to baseball. Joe
had never eaten such a delightful meal, though if
you had asked him afterward what the menu was
made up of, he could not have told you. It was
mostly Mabel, I think, from the soup to the dessert.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>BAD NEWS</small></h2>


<p>Grounds that were soggy and wet, and a dreary
drizzle of rain, prevented a game next day, and
there was much disappointment. Weather reports
were eagerly scanned, and the skies looked at more
than once.</p>

<p>“I think it’ll clear to-morrow,” remarked Joe
to Charlie Hall.</p>

<p>“I sure hope so. I want to see what sort of
meat these Newkirk fellows are made of since we
played against ’em last.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re husky enough, as we found,
Charlie,” for there had been several league games
between this team and the Pittston nine, but in
the latter town. Now the tables might be turned.</p>

<p>“They’ve got some new players,” went on
Charlie, “and a pitcher who’s said to be a
marvel.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got me,” laughed Joe, in simulated
pride.</p>

<p>“That’s right, old man, and I’m glad of it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
think you’re going to pull us to the top in this
pennant race.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t such a swelled head as to think
that,” spoke Joe, “but I’m going to work hard&mdash;I
guess we all are. But what does it look like for
Clevefield to-day? You know she’s got to lose
and we’ve got to win to put us on top.”</p>

<p>“I know. There wasn’t any report of rain
there, so the game must be going on. We ought
to get results soon. Come on over to the ticker.”</p>

<p>It was after luncheon, and the game in Clevefield,
with the Washburg nine, would soon start.
Then telegraphic reports of the contest that, in a
way, meant so much for Pittston would begin
coming in.</p>

<p>After the delightful dinner Joe had had with
Mabel his pleasure was further added to when
he went with her to the theatre. Reggie telephoned
that he could not get back in time, and
asked Joe to take his sister, she having the tickets.</p>

<p>Of course the young pitcher was delighted, but
he could not get over the uneasy feeling that
young Varley was suspicious of him.</p>

<p>“Hang it all!” exclaimed Joe, mentally. “I’ve
just got to get that out of his mind! But how?
Only by finding his watch or Mabel’s jewelry, and
I suppose I might as well look for a needle in a
haystack.”</p>

<p>Joe sat in the hotel corridor, looking over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
newspaper, and waiting for some news of the
Clevefield game, as many of his team were doing.
An item caught the eye of the young pitcher that
caused him to start. It was to the effect that the
unfortunate Pop Dutton had been arrested for
creating a scene at a ball park.</p>

<p>“Poor old man!” mused Joe. “I wish I could
do something for him. I feel sort of responsible
for him, since I saved his life. I wonder if he
couldn’t be straightened up? I must have another
talk with Gregory about him.”</p>

<p>A yell from some of the players gathered about
the news ticker in the smoking room brought Joe
to his feet.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he called to Charlie Hall.</p>

<p>“Washburg got three runs the first inning and
Clevefield none!” was the answer. “It looks as
if Washburg would have a walk-over. And you
know what that means for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we win to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Win! Of course we’ll win, you old bone-head!”
cried Charlie, clapping Joe affectionately
on the back.</p>

<p>Further news from the game was eagerly
awaited and when the last inning had been ticked
off, and Washburg had won by a margin of three
runs, the Pittston team was delighted.</p>

<p>Not at the downfall of fellow players, understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but because it gave Pittston the coveted
chance to be at the top of the first division.</p>

<p>“Boys, we’ve just got to win that game to-morrow!”
cried Gregory.</p>

<p>“If they don’t I’ll make them live on bread and
water for a week!” cried Trainer McGuire, with
a twinkle in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>The second day following proved all that could
be desired from a weather standpoint for a ball
game, the grounds having dried up meanwhile. It
was bright and sunny, but not too warm, and soon
after breakfast the team was ordered out on the
field for light practice.</p>

<p>This was necessary as their day of comparative
idleness, added to the damp character of the
weather, had made them all a little stiff.</p>

<p>“Get limbered up, boys,” advised Jimmie
Mack. “You’ll need all the speed and power
you can bring along to-day. Joe, how’s your
arm?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess,” answered the young
pitcher.</p>

<p>“Well, do some light practice. Come on. I’ll
catch for you a while.”</p>

<p>There had been some slight changes made in
the Newkirk grounds since last season, and Gregory
wanted his players to familiarize themselves
with the new layout. Joe was delighted with the
diamond. Though Newkirk was a smaller city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
than Pittston the ball field was kept in better
shape.</p>

<p>“Of course it isn’t the Polo Grounds,” Joe
confided to Charlie Hall, “but they’re pretty
good.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if I’ll ever get a chance to play on
the Polo Grounds?” murmured Charlie, half enviously.
“It must be great!”</p>

<p>“It is!” cried Joe, with memories of the Yale-Princeton
contest he had taken part in there.
“And I’m going to do it again, some time!”</p>

<p>“You are?”</p>

<p>“I sure am. I’m going to break into a big
league if it’s possible.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Joe!”</p>

<p>“Still, the grounds aren’t everything, Charlie,”
went on Joe. “We’ve got to play the best ball to
win the game.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll do it, too! Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>The practice was worked up to a fast and
snappy point, and then Gregory sent his men for a
brisk walk, to be followed by a shower bath in
preparation for the afternoon contest.</p>

<p>Certainly when the Pittston team started for
the grounds again they were a bright, clean-looking
lot of players. Joe was wondering whether
he would have a chance to pitch, but, following his
usual policy, the crafty manager did not announce
his battery until the last moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a big crowd out to see the game, for
the rivalry in the Central League was now intense,
and interest was well keyed up. Joe had
seen Mabel and her brother start for the grounds,
and he wished, more than ever before, perhaps,
that he would be sent to the mound to do battle
for his team.</p>

<p>The Newkirk men were out on the diamond
when the Pittston players arrived, and, after an
interval the latter team was given a chance to
warm up. Joe and the other pitchers began their
usual practice, and Joe felt that he could do himself
justice if he could but get a chance.</p>

<p>There was silence as the batteries were announced,
and Joe could not help feeling a keen
disappointment as Tooley, the south-paw, was
named to open the contest.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of queer batters on the Newkirks,”
Joe heard Bob Newton, the right fielder,
say to Terry Hanson, who played left. “I guess
that’s the reason the old man wants Tooley to feel
them out.”</p>

<p>“I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Play ball!” droned the umpire as the gong
clanged, and George Lee, the second baseman,
who was first at bat, strolled out to pick up his
club.</p>

<p>The first part of the game was rather a surprise
to the Pittston players. Lee was struck out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with amazing ease, and even Jimmie Mack, who
had the best batting average of any on the team,
“fell” for a delusive “fade-away” ball.</p>

<p>“But I’ve got his number!” he exclaimed, as
he nodded at the opposing pitcher. “He won’t
get me again.”</p>

<p>Pittston did not get a run, though she had three
men on bases when the last one went down, and it
looked as though her chances were good.</p>

<p>Then came more disappointment when Tooley
failed to get his batters, and Newkirk had two
runs chalked up to her credit. The second inning
was almost like the first and then at the proper
time, Gregory, with a decisive gesture, signalled to
Joe.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to pitch us out of this hole!” he
said, grimly. Collin, who had said openly that he
expected to be called on, looked blackly at our
hero.</p>

<p>As Joe started to take his place a messenger
boy handed him a telegram. He was a little
startled at first, and then laughed at his fears.</p>

<p>“Probably good wishes from home,” he murmured,
as he tore open the envelope. And then
the bright day seemed to go black as he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<small>JOE’S PLUCK</small></h2>


<p>Joe’s distress at receiving the bad news was so
evident, at least to Gregory, that the manager hurried
over to the young pitcher and asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, old man? Something upset
you?”</p>

<p>For answer Joe simply held out the message.</p>

<p>“I say! That’s too bad!” exclaimed Gregory
sympathetically. “Let’s see now. You can get a
train in about an hour, I think. Skip right off.
I’ll make it all right.” It was his business to know
much about trains, and he was almost a “walking
timetable.”</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry, old man!” he went on. “Come
back to us when you can. You’ll find us waiting.”</p>

<p>Joe made up his mind quickly. It was characteristic
of him to do this, and it was one of the
traits that made him, in after years, such a phenomenal
pitcher.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m not going home,” said Joe, quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not going home! Why?” cried Gregory.</p>

<p>“At least not until after the game,” went on
Joe. “The telegram says my father isn’t in any
immediate danger, and I could not gain much by
starting now. I’m going to stay and pitch. That
is, if you’ll let me.”</p>

<p>“Let you! Of course I’ll let you. But can you
stand the gaff, old man? I don’t want to seem
heartless, but the winning of this game means a
lot to me, and if you don’t feel just up to the
mark&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can pitch&mdash;at least, I think I can,” said
Joe, not wishing to appear too egotistical. “I
mean this won’t make me flunk.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty plucky of you, Joe, and I appreciate
it. Now don’t make a mistake. It won’t
hurt your standing with the club a bit if you go
now. I’ll put Collin in, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll pitch!” said Joe, determinedly. “After
that it will be time enough to start for home.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Gregory. “But if you
want to quit at any time, give me the signal. And
I’ll tell you what I’ll do. Have you a ’phone at
home?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll have someone get your house on the
long distance wire, and find out just how your
father is. I’ll also send word that you’ll start to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“That will be fine!” cried Joe, and already he
felt better. The bad news had shocked him for
the time, though.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire, for there had
been a little delay over the talk between Joe and
the manager.</p>

<p>“Just keep quiet about it, though,” advised the
manager to the young pitcher. “It may only upset
things if it gets out. Are you sure you can
stand it?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m going to stand it!” responded Joe,
gamely.</p>

<p>He faced his first batter with a little sense of
uncertainty. But Nelson, who was catching,
nodded cheerfully at him, and gave a signal for a
certain ball that Joe, himself, had decided would
best deceive that man with the stick. He sent it
in rushingly, and was delighted to hear the umpire
call:</p>

<p>“Strike one!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way!”</p>

<p>“Two more like that and he’s a goner!”</p>

<p>“Slam ’em in, Matson!”</p>

<p>Joe flushed with pleasure at the encouraging
cries. He wondered if Mabel was joining in the
applause that frequently swept over the grandstand
at a brilliant play.</p>

<p>Again Joe threw, and all the batter could do
was to hit a foul, which was not caught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a ball, followed by another, and Joe
began to get a bit anxious.</p>

<p>“That’s the boy!” welled up encouragingly
from the crowd.</p>

<p>Joe tried a moist ball&mdash;a delivery of which he
was not very certain as yet, but the batter “fell
for it” and whirled around as he missed it cleanly.</p>

<p>“Three strikes&mdash;batter’s out!” howled the umpire,
and the man went back to the bench.</p>

<p>The next candidate managed to get a single, but
was caught stealing second, and Joe had a chance
to retire his third man.</p>

<p>It was a chance not to be missed, and he indulged
in a few delaying tactics in order to place,
in his mind, the hitter and his special peculiarities.</p>

<p>With a snap of his wrist Joe sent in an out
curve, but the manner in which the batter leaped
for it, missing it only by a narrow margin, told
our hero that this ball was just “pie,” for his
antagonist.</p>

<p>“Mustn’t do that again,” thought Joe. “He’ll
slam it over the fence if I do.”</p>

<p>The next&mdash;an in-shoot&mdash;was hit, but only for a
foul, and Joe, whose heart had gone into his throat
as he heard the crack of the bat, breathed easier.
Then, just to puzzle the batter, after delivering a
“moistener” that fell off and was called a ball,
Joe sent in a “teaser”&mdash;a slow one&mdash;that fooled
the player, who flied out to shortstop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe was beginning to feel more confidence in
himself.</p>

<p>The others of the Pittston team grinned encouragingly
at Joe, and Gregory clasped his arms
about the young pitcher as he came in to the bench.</p>

<p>“Can you stick it out?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure! Have you any word yet on the ’phone?”</p>

<p>“No. Not yet. I’m expecting Hastings back
any minute,” naming a substitute player who had
not gone into the game, and whom the manager
had sent to call up Joe’s house. “But are you
sure you want to keep on playing?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Joe. He had a glimpse of
Collin, and fancied that the eager look on the
other pitcher’s face turned to one of disappointment.</p>

<p>“You’re beating me out,” said Tooley, the
south-paw, with an easy laugh.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Joe, for he knew how it felt
to be supplanted.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not worrying. My turn will come
again. One can’t be up to the mark all the while.”</p>

<p>Pittston managed to get a run over the plate
that inning, and when it came time for Joe to go
to the mound again he had better news to cheer
him up.</p>

<p>Word had come over the telephone that Mr.
Matson, while making some tests at the Harvester
Works, had been injured by an explosion of acids.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Some had gone into his face, burning him badly.</p>

<p>His life was in no danger, but his eyesight might
be much impaired, if not lost altogether. Nothing
could be told in this respect for a day or so.</p>

<p>Hastings had been talking to Joe’s sister Clara,
to whom he explained that Joe would start for
home as soon as the game was over. Mrs. Matson
was bearing up well under the strain, the message
said, and Joe was told not to worry.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll be able to do better,” said the young
pitcher, with a little smile. “Thanks for the good
news.”</p>

<p>“You’re doing all right, boy!” cried Gregory.
“I think we’re going to win!”</p>

<p>But it was not to be as easy as saying it. The
Newkirk men fought hard, and to the last inch.
They had an excellent pitcher&mdash;a veteran&mdash;who
was well backed up with a fielding force, and every
run the Pittstons got they fully earned.</p>

<p>Joe warmed up to his work, and to the howling
delight of the crowd struck out two men in succession,
after one had gone out on a pop fly, while
there were two on bases. That was a test of nerve,
for something might have broken loose at any
moment.</p>

<p>But Joe held himself well in hand, and watched
his batters. He so varied his delivery that he puzzled
them, and working in unison with Nelson very
little got past them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a little spurt on the part of Newkirk,
and they “sweetened” their score until there was
a tie. It was in the ninth inning, necessitating another
to decide the matter.</p>

<p>“If we can get one run we’ll have a chance to
win,” declared Gregory. “That is, if you can hold
them in the last half of the tenth, Joe.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best!”</p>

<p>“I know you will, my boy!”</p>

<p>For a time it looked as though it could not be
done. Two of the Pittston players went down in
rapid succession before the magnificent throwing
of the Newkirk pitcher. Then he made a fatal
mistake. He “fed” a slow ball to John Holme,
the big third baseman, who met it squarely with his
stick, and when the shouting was over John was
safely on the third sack.</p>

<p>“Now bring him home, Joe!” cried the crowd,
as the young pitcher stepped to the plate. It was
not the easiest thing in the world to stand up there
and face a rival pitcher, with the knowledge that
your hit might win the game by bringing in the
man on third. And especially after the advent of
the telegram. But <a href="#image01">Joe steadied himself, and
smiled at his opponent</a>.</p>

<p>He let the first ball go, and a strike was called
on him. There was a groan from grandstand and
bleachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take your time, Joe!” called Gregory, soothingly.
“Get what you want.”</p>

<p>It came. The ball sailed for the plate at the
right height, and Joe correctly gaged it. His bat
met it squarely, with a resounding “plunk!”</p>

<p>“That’s the boy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a beaut!”</p>

<p>“Take third on that!”</p>

<p>“Come on home, you ice wagon!”</p>

<p>“Run! Run! Run!”</p>

<p>It was a wildly shrieking mob that leaped to its
feet, cheering on Joe and Holme. On and on ran
the young pitcher. He had a confused vision of
the centre fielder running back to get the ball which
had dropped well behind him. Joe also saw
Holme racing in from third. He could hear the
yells of the crowd and fancied&mdash;though of course
it could not be so&mdash;that he could hear the voice of
Mabel calling to him.</p>

<p>On and on ran Joe, and stopped, safe on second,
Holme had gone in with the winning run.</p>

<p>But that was all. The next man struck out, and
Joe was left on the “half-way station.”</p>

<p>“But we’re one ahead, and if we can hold the
lead we’ve got ’em!” cried Gregory. “Joe, my
boy, it’s up to you! Can you hold ’em down?”</p>

<p>He looked earnestly at the young pitcher.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ll do it!” cried Joe.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>A SLIM CHANCE</small></h2>


<p>There was an almost breathless silence as Joe
walked to the mound to begin what he hoped
would be the ending of the final inning of the
game. If he could prevent, with the aid of his
mates, the Newkirk team from gaining a run, the
Pittstons would be at the top of the list. If not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But Joe did not like to think about that. He
was under a great nervous strain, not only because
of the news concerning his father, but because of
what his failure or success might mean to the club
he had the honor to represent.</p>

<p>“I’ve just got to win!” said Joe to himself.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Joe had been holding himself a little in reserve
up to now; that is, he had not used the last ounce
of ability that he had, for he could see that the
game was going to be a hard one, and that a little
added “punch” at the last moment might make or
break for victory.</p>

<p>The young pitcher had a good delivery of what
is known as the “jump” ball. It is sent in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
all the force possible, and fairly jumps as it approaches
the plate. It is often used to drive the
batsman away from the rubber. It is supposed to
go straight for the plate, or the inside corner, and
about shoulder high. A long preliminary swing is
needed for this ball, and it is pitched with an overhand
delivery.</p>

<p>Joe had practiced this until he was a fair master
of it, but he realized that it was exhausting. Always
after sending in a number of these his arm
would be lame, and he was not good for much the
next day. But now he thought the time had come
to use it, varying it, of course, with other styles of
delivery.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to hold ’em down!” thought Joe.</p>

<p>He realized that the attention of all was on him,
and he wished he could catch the eyes of a certain
girl he knew sat in the grandstand watching him.
Joe also felt that Collin, his rival, was watching
him narrowly, and he could imagine the veteran
pitcher muttering:</p>

<p>“Why do they send in a young cub like that
when so much depends on it? Why didn’t Gregory
call me?”</p>

<p>But the manager evidently knew what he was
doing.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire again, at the conclusion
of the sending in of a practice ball or two.</p>

<p>Joe caught his breath sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s now or never!” he thought as he grasped
the ball in readiness for the jump. “It’s going to
strain me, but if I go home for a day or so I can
rest up.”</p>

<p>In went the horsehide sphere with great force.
It accomplished just what Joe hoped it would.
The batter instinctively stepped back, but there
was no need. The ball neatly clipped the corner of
the plate, and the umpire called:</p>

<p>“Strike one!”</p>

<p>Instantly there was a howl from the crowd.</p>

<p>“That’s the way!”</p>

<p>“Two more, Matson, old man!”</p>

<p>“Make him stand up!”</p>

<p>“Slam it out, Johnson!”</p>

<p>The batter had his friends as well as Joe.</p>

<p>But the battle was not half won yet. There
were two men to be taken care of after this one
was disposed of, and he still had his chances.</p>

<p>Joe signalled to his catcher that he would slip
in a “teaser” now, and the man in the wire mask
nodded his understanding. The batter smiled, in
anticipation of having a “ball” called on him, but
was amazed, not to say angry, when he heard from
the umpire the drawling:</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;two!”</p>

<p>Instantly there came a storm of protest, some
from the crowd, a half-uttered sneer from the batter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
himself, but more from his manager and team-mates
on the players’ bench.</p>

<p>“Forget it!” sharply cried the umpire, supreme
master that he was. “I said ‘strike,’ and a strike
it goes. Play ball!”</p>

<p>Joe was delighted. It showed that they were
now to have fair treatment from the deciding
power, though during the first part of the game
the umpire’s decisions had not been altogether fair
to Pittston.</p>

<p>The crowd was breathlessly eager again, as Joe
wound up once more. Then there was a mad yell
as the batter hit the next ball.</p>

<p>“Go on! Go on! You&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Foul!” yelled the umpire, and there was a
groan of disappointment.</p>

<p>Joe was a little nervous, so it is no wonder that
he was called for a ball on his next delivery. But
following that he sent in as neat an out curve as
could be desired. The batter missed it by a foot,
and throwing his stick down in disgust walked to
the bench.</p>

<p>“Only two more, old man!” called Gregory
encouragingly. “Only two more. We’ve got
their number.”</p>

<p>Then came an attempt on the part of the crowd,
which naturally was mostly in sympathy with their
home team, to get Joe’s “goat.” He was hooted
at and reviled. He was advised to go back to college,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and to let a man take his place. Joe only
grinned and made no answer. The nervous strain
under which he was playing increased. He wanted,
no one perhaps but Gregory knew how much,
to get away and take a train for home, to be with
his suffering father.</p>

<p>But there were two more men to put out. And
Joe did it.</p>

<p>That is, he struck out the next man. The third
one singled, and when the best batter of the opposing
team came up, Joe faced him confidently.</p>

<p>After two balls had been called, and the crowd
was at the fever point of expectancy, Joe got a
clean strike. It was followed by a foul, and then
came a little pop fly that was easily caught by the
young pitcher, who hardly had to move from his
mound.</p>

<p>“Pittston wins!”</p>

<p>“Pittston is up head!”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Joe Matson!”</p>

<p>They were given with a will, too, for the crowd
loved a plucky player, even if it was on the other
side.</p>

<p>But Joe did not stay to hear this. He wanted
to catch the first train for home, and hurried into
the dressing room. He spoke to Gregory, saying
that he was going, and would be back as soon as he
could.</p>

<p>“Take your time, old man; take your time,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
said the manager kindly. “You did a lot for us
to-day, and now I guess we can hold our own until
you come back.”</p>

<p>There were sympathetic inquiries from Joe’s
fellow players when they heard what had happened.
Joe wanted to say good-bye to Mabel, but
did not quite see how he could do it. He could
hardly find her in that crowd.</p>

<p>But chance favored him, and as he was entering
the hotel to get his grip, he met her.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was splendid!” she cried with girlish
enthusiasm, holding out her slim, pretty hand.
“It was fine! However did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I guess because I knew you were watching
me!” exclaimed Joe with a boldness that he himself
wondered at later.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s awfully nice of you to say,” she
answered, with a blush. “I wish I could believe
it!”</p>

<p>“You can!” said Joe, still more boldly.</p>

<p>“But you&mdash;you look as though something had
happened,” she went on, for surely Joe’s face told
that.</p>

<p>“There has,” he said, quietly, and he told of the
accident to his father.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry!” she exclaimed, clasping
his hand again. “And you pitched after you heard
the news! How brave of you! Is there anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
we can do&mdash;my brother&mdash;or I?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” responded Joe, in a low voice.
“I am hoping it will not be serious.”</p>

<p>“You must let me know&mdash;let Reggie know,” she
went on. “We shall be here for some days yet.”</p>

<p>Joe promised to write, and then hurried off to
catch his train. It was a long ride to Riverside,
and to Joe, who was all impatience to be there, the
train seemed to be the very slowest kind of a
freight, though it really was an express.</p>

<p>But all things must have an end, and that torturing
journey did. Joe arrived in his home town
late one afternoon, and took a carriage to the
house. He saw Clara at the window, and could
see that she had been crying. She slipped to the
door quickly, and held up a warning finger.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what’s the matter?” asked Joe in a
hoarse whisper. “Is&mdash;is he worse?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s a little better, if anything. But he
has just fallen asleep, and so has mother. She is
quite worn out. Come in and I’ll tell you about
it. Oh, Joe! I’m so glad you’re home!”</p>

<p>Clara related briefly the particulars of the accident,
and then the doctor came in. By this time
Mrs. Matson had awakened and welcomed her
son.</p>

<p>“What chance is there, Doctor,” asked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
young pitcher; “what chance to save his eyesight?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a chance; but, I’m sorry to say,
it is only a slim one,” was the answer. “It’s too
soon to say with certainty, however. Another day
will have to pass. I hope all will be well, but now
all I can say is that there is a chance.”</p>

<p>Joe felt his heart beating hard, and then, bracing
himself to meet the emergency if it should
come, he put his arm around his weeping mother,
and said, as cheerfully as he could:</p>

<p>“Well, I believe chance is going to be on our
side. I’m going to use a bit of baseball slang, and
say I have a ‘hunch’ that we’ll win out!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” cried Dr. Birch,
heartily.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>OLD POP AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>Dr. Birch remained for some little time at the
Matson home, going over in detail with Joe just
what the nature of his father’s injuries were. In
brief, while experimenting on a certain new method
of chilling steel, for use in a corn sheller, Mr.
Matson mixed some acids together.</p>

<p>Unknown to him a workman had, accidentally,
substituted one very strong acid for a weak one.
When the mixture was put into an iron pot there
was an explosion. Some of the acid, and splinters
of iron, flew up into the face of the inventor.</p>

<p>“And until I can tell whether the acid, or a piece
of steel, injured his eyes, Joe, I can’t say for sure
what we shall have to do,” concluded the doctor.</p>

<p>“You mean about an operation?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If we have to perform one it will be a
very delicate one, and it will cost a lot of money;
there are only a few men in this country capable of
doing it, and their fees, naturally, are high. But
we won’t think of that now. I think I will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in and see how he is. If he is well enough I want
you to see him. It will do him good.”</p>

<p>“And me, too,” added Joe, who was under a
great strain, though he did not show it.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson was feeling better after his rest,
and Joe was allowed to come into the darkened
room. He braced himself for the ordeal.</p>

<p>“How are you, Son,” said the inventor weakly.</p>

<p>“Fine, Dad. But I’m sorry to see you laid up
this way.”</p>

<p>“Well, Joe, it couldn’t be helped. I should
have been more careful. But I guess I’ll pull
through. How is baseball?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better, Dad! We’re at the top of
the heap! I just helped to win the deciding game
before I came on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard your mother talking about the
telephone message. I’m glad you didn’t come
away without playing. Have you the pennant
yet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. That won’t be decided for a couple
of months. But we’re going to win it!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I like to hear!”</p>

<p>Dr. Birch did not permit his patient to talk long,
and soon Joe had to leave the room. The physician
said later that he thought there was a slight
improvement in Mr. Matson’s condition, though
of course the matter of saving his eyesight could
not yet be decided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“But if we do have to have an operation,” said
Mrs. Matson. “I don’t see where the money is
coming from. Your father’s investments are turning
out so badly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that, Mother,” broke in
Joe.</p>

<p>“But I have to, Joe. If an operation is needed
we’ll have to get the money. And from where is
more than I know,” she added, hopelessly.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the money!” exclaimed the young
pitcher in energetic tones.</p>

<p>“How?” asked his mother. “I’m sure you
can’t make enough at ball playing.”</p>

<p>“No, perhaps not at ordinary ball playing,
Mother, but at the end of the season, when the deciding
games for the pennant are played off, they
always draw big crowds, and the players on the
winning team come in for a good share of the receipts.
I’ll use mine for the operation.”</p>

<p>“But your team may not win the pennant, Joe,”
said Clara.</p>

<p>“We’re going to win!” cried the young pitcher.
“I feel it in my bones! Don’t worry, Mother.”</p>

<p>But, naturally, Mrs. Matson could not help it,
in spite of Joe’s brave words. Clara, though, was
cheered up.</p>

<p>“There’s more to baseball than I thought,” she
said.</p>

<p>“There’s more in it than I’ll ever learn,” admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Joe, frankly. “Of course our pennant-deciding
games aren’t like the world series, but I
understand they bring in a lot of money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Matson was quite improved the next day,
but Dr. Birch, and another physician, who was
called in consultation, could not settle the matter
about the eyes.</p>

<p>“It will be fully a month before we can decide
about the operation,” said the expert. “In the
meanwhile he is in no danger, and the delay will
give him a chance to get back his strength. We
shall have to wait.”</p>

<p>As nothing could be gained by Joe’s staying
home, and as his baseball money was very much
needed at this trying time, it was decided that he
had better rejoin his team.</p>

<p>He bade his parents and sister good-bye, and
arranged to have word sent to him every day as to
his father’s condition.</p>

<p>“And don’t you worry about that money,
Mother,” he said as he kissed her. “I’ll be here
with it when it’s needed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe!” was all she said, but she looked
happier.</p>

<p>Joe went back to join the team at Delamont,
where they were scheduled to play four games, and
then they would return to their home town of
Pittston.</p>

<p>From the newspapers Joe learned that his team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
had taken three of the four contests in Newkirk,
and might have had the fourth but for bad pitching
on the part of Collin.</p>

<p>“Maybe he won’t be so bitter against me
now,” thought Joe. “He isn’t such a wonder himself.”</p>

<p>Joe was glancing over the paper as the train
sped on toward Delamont. He was looking over
other baseball news, and at the scores of the big
leagues.</p>

<p>“I wonder when I’ll break into them?” mused
Joe, as he glanced rather enviously at several large
pictures of celebrated players in action. “I’m
going to do it as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>Then the thought came to him of how hard it
was for a young and promising player to get away
from the club that controlled him.</p>

<p>“The only way would be to slump in form,”
said Joe to himself, “and then even if he did get
his release no other team would want him. It’s a
queer game, and not altogether fair, but I suppose
it has to be played that way. Well, no use worrying
about the big leagues until I get a call from
one. There’ll be time enough then to wonder
about my release.”</p>

<p>As Joe was about to lay aside the paper he was
aware of a controversy going on a few seats ahead
of him. The conductor had stopped beside an
elderly man and was saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll have to get off, that’s all there is to it.
You deliberately rode past your station, and you’re
only trying to see how far you can go without being
caught. You get off at the next station, or if you
don’t I’ll stop the train when I get to you and put
you off, even if it’s in the middle of a trestle.
You’re trying to beat your way, and you know it!
You had a ticket only to Clearville, and you didn’t
get off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t you pass me on to Delamont?”
pleaded the man. “I admit I was trying to beat
you. But I’ve got to get to Delamont. I’ve the
promise of work there, and God knows I need it.
I’ll pay the company back when I earn it.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” sneered the conductor, “that’s too
thin. I’ve heard that yarn before. No, sir; you
get off at the next station, or I’ll have the brakeman
run you off. Understand that! No more
monkey business. Either you give me money or
a ticket, or off you go.”</p>

<p>“All right,” was the short answer. “I reckon
I’ll have to do it.”</p>

<p>The man turned and at the sight of his face Joe
started.</p>

<p>“Pop Dutton!” exclaimed the young pitcher,
hardly aware that he had spoken aloud.</p>

<p>“That’s me,” was the answer. “Oh&mdash;why&mdash;it’s
Joe!” he added, and his face lighted up. Then
a look of despair came over it. Joe decided quickly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
No matter what Gregory and the others said
he had determined to help this broken-down old
ball player.</p>

<p>“What’s the fare to Delamont?” Joe asked the
conductor.</p>

<p>“One-fifty, from the last station.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay it,” went on Joe, handing over a bill.
The ticket-puncher looked at him curiously, and
then, without a word, made the change, and gave
Joe the little excess slip which was good for ten
cents, to be collected at any ticket office.</p>

<p>“Say, Joe Matson, that’s mighty good of you!”
exclaimed Old Pop Dutton, as Joe came to sit beside
him. “Mighty good!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” spoke Joe easily. “What
are you going to do in Delamont?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a chance to be assistant ground-keeper
at the ball park. I&mdash;I’m trying to&mdash;trying to get
back to a decent life, Joe, but&mdash;but it’s hard
work.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m going to help you!” exclaimed the
young pitcher, impulsively. “I’m going to ask
Gregory if he can’t give you something to do. Do
you think you could play ball again?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Joe,” was the doubtful answer.
“They say when they get&mdash;get like me&mdash;that they
can’t come back. I couldn’t pitch, that’s sure.
I’ve got something the matter with my arm. Doctor
said a slight operation would cure me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
I might be better than ever, but I haven’t any
money for operations. But I could be a fair fielder,
I think, and maybe I could fatten up my batting
average.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to try?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Would I?” The man’s tone was answer
enough.</p>

<p>“Then I’m going to get you the chance,” declared
Joe. “But you’ll have to take care of yourself,
and&mdash;get in better shape.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Joe. I’m ashamed of myself&mdash;that’s
what I am. I’ve gone pretty far down, but
I believe I can come back. I’ve quit drinking, and
I’ve cut my old acquaintances.”</p>

<p>Joe looked carefully at Pop Dutton. The marks
of the life he had led of late were to be seen in his
trembling hands, and in his blood-shot eyes. But
there was a fine frame and a good physique to
build on. Joe had great hopes.</p>

<p>“You come on to Delamont with me,” said the
young pitcher, “and I’ll look after you until you
get straightened out. Then we’ll see what the
doctor says, and Gregory, too. I believe he’ll give
you the chance.”</p>

<p>“Joe! I don’t know how to thank you!” said
the man earnestly. “If I can ever do something
for you&mdash;but I don’t believe I ever can.”</p>

<p>Pop Dutton little realized how soon the time
was to come when he could do Joe a great favor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>IN DESPAIR</small></h2>


<p>Joe and Pop Dutton arrived at the hotel in
Delamont ahead of the team, which was on the
way from Newkirk after losing the last game of
the four. But at that Pittston was still in the lead,
and now all energies would be bent on increasing
the percentage so that even the loss of a game now
and then would not pull the club from its place.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Joe,” said Pop, when he and
Joe had eaten, “this may be all right for me, but
it isn’t going to do you any good.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean consorting with me in this way. I
can’t stay at this hotel with you, the other players
would guy you too much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about that.”</p>

<p>“Well, but I do. Now, look here. I appreciate
a whole lot what you’re doing for me, but it
would be better if I could go to some other hotel.
Then, if you can, you get Gregory to give me a
chance. I’ll work at anything&mdash;assistant trainer,
or anything&mdash;to get in shape again. But it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
be better for me not to stay here where the team
puts up.</p>

<p>“If things go right, and I can go back to
Pittston with the boys, I’ll go to some quiet boarding
house. Being at a hotel isn’t any too good for
me. It brings back old times.”</p>

<p>Joe saw the logic of Pop’s talk, and consented.
He gave the broken-down player enough money to
enable him to live quietly for several days. When
the team came Joe determined to put the question
to the manager.</p>

<p>As Joe had registered he looked over the book
to see if he knew any of the guests at the hotel.
Though he did not admit so to himself he had half
a forlorn hope that he might find the name of
Mabel and her brother there. He even looked
sharply at the various pieces of luggage as they
were carried in by the bell boys, but he did not see
the curious valise that had played such an unpleasant
part in his life.</p>

<p>Joe was feeling very “fit.” The little rest, even
though it was broken by anxiety concerning his
father, had done him good, and the arm that had
been strained in the game that meant so much to
Pittston was in fine shape again. Joe felt able to
pitch his very best.</p>

<p>“And I guess we’ll have to do our prettiest
if we want to keep at the top of the heap,” he
reasoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the team arrived, and noisily and enthusiastically
welcomed Joe to their midst again.</p>

<p>Seeking the first opportunity, Joe had a talk
with the manager concerning Pop Dutton. At first
Gregory would not listen, and tried to dissuade
Joe from having anything to do with the old player.
But the young pitcher had determined to go
on with his rescue work, and pleaded with such
good effect that finally the manager said:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give him a chance, providing he
shows that he can keep straight. I don’t believe he
can, but, for your sake, I’m willing to make the experiment.
I’ve done it before, and been taken in
every time. I’m sure this will only be another, but
you might as well learn your lesson now as later.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ll have much to learn,” answered
Joe with a smile. “I think Pop can come
back.”</p>

<p>“The players who can do that are as scarce as
hens’ teeth,” was the rejoinder of the manager.
“But I’ll take this last chance. Of course he can’t
begin to play right off the bat. He’s got to get in
training. By the way, I suppose he has his release?”
The manager looked questioningly at Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He’s free and clear to make any contract
he likes. He told me that.”</p>

<p>“I imagined so. No one wants him. I’m
afraid I’m foolish for taking him on, but I’ll do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
it to please you. I’ll take his option, and pay him
a small sum.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll do the rest,” returned Joe, eagerly.
“I’m going to have his arm looked at, and then
couldn’t you get him a place where he could do
out-door work&mdash;say help keep our grounds in
shape?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll think about it, Joe. But about yourself?
Are you ready to sail in again?”</p>

<p>“I sure am. What are the prospects?”</p>

<p>“Well, they might be better. Collin isn’t doing
any too well. I’m thinking of buying another
pitcher to use when there’s not much at stake.
Gus Harrison is laid up&mdash;sprained his knee a little
making a mean slide. I’ve got to do some shifting,
and I need every game I can get from now on.
But I guess we’ll come out somehow.”</p>

<p>But the team did not come out “somehow.” It
came out “nohow,” for it lost its first game with
Delamont the next day, and this, coupled with the
winning of a double-header by Clevefield, put that
team in the lead and sent Pittston to second place.</p>

<p>Joe worked hard, so hard that he began to go
to pieces in the seventh inning, and had to be replaced
by Tooley, who came into the breach wonderfully
well, and, while he did not save the day,
he prevented a disgraceful beating. Joe was in
the dumps after this despite the cheerful, optimistic
attitude of the manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe’s one consolation, though, was that Pop
Dutton was in the way of being provided for.
The old pitcher was holding himself rigidly in line,
and taking care of himself. He had a talk with
Gregory&mdash;a shame-faced sort of talk on Pop’s
part&mdash;and was promised a place at the Pittston
ball park. It was agreed that he would go into
training, and try to get back to his old form.</p>

<p>Gregory did not believe this could be done, but
if a miracle should happen he realized that he
would own a valuable player&mdash;one that would be
an asset to his club.</p>

<p>And then something happened. How it came
about no one could say for a certainty, but Joe
went “stale.”</p>

<p>He fell off woefully in his pitching, and the loss
of several games was attributable directly to his
“slump.”</p>

<p>Joe could not account for it, nor could his
friends; but the fact remained. Pittston dropped
to third place, and the papers which gave much
space to the doings of the Central League began
to make sarcastic remarks.</p>

<p>On the diamond, too, Joe had to suffer the gibes
of the crowd, which is always ready to laud a successful
player, and only too ready, also, to laugh
at one who has a temporary setback.</p>

<p>Joe was in despair, but in his letters home he
kept cheerful. He did not want his folks to worry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Regularly he sent money to his mother, taking out
of his salary check almost more than he could
really afford. Also he felt the drain of looking
after Pop, but now that the latter had regular
work on the diamond, keeping it in order, the old
pitcher was, in a measure, self-supporting.</p>

<p>Pop was rapidly becoming more like his former
self, but it would take some time yet. He indulged
in light practice, Joe often having him catch for
him when no one else was available. As yet Pop
attempted no pitching, the doctor to whom Joe
took him warning him against it.</p>

<p>“There will have to be a slight operation on certain
muscles,” said the medical man, “but I prefer
to wait a bit before doing it. You will be in better
shape then.”</p>

<p>“You’re taking too much trouble about me,
Joe,” remarked the veteran player one day.</p>

<p>“Not a bit too much,” responded Joe, heartily.</p>

<p>From Joe’s father came slightly encouraging
news. The need of an operation was not yet settled,
and Mr. Matson’s general health had improved.</p>

<p>“And we can bless baseball a lot!” wrote Mrs.
Matson to her son. “I’m sorry I ever said anything
against it, Joe. If it were not for the money
you make at the game I don’t know what we’d do
now.”</p>

<p>Joe was glad his mother saw matters in a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
light, but he was also a little disturbed. His
pitching was not what it should be, and he felt, if
his form fell off much more, that he would not
last long, even in a small league.</p>

<p>Occasionally he did well&mdash;even brilliantly, and
the team had hopes. Then would come a “slump,”
and they would lose a much-needed game that
would have lifted them well toward front place.</p>

<p>Joe’s despair grew, and he wondered what he
could do to get back to his good form. Clevefield,
the ancient rivals of Pittston, were now firmly
entrenched in first place, and there remained
only about a quarter of the league season yet to
play.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to hustle if we want that pennant!”
said Gregory, and his tone was not encouraging.
Joe thought of what he had promised about having
the money for his father’s operation, and wondered
whether he could do as he said.</p>

<p>But I must not give the impression that all
was unhappiness and gloom in the Pittston team.
True, the members felt badly about losing, but
their nerve did not desert them, and they even
joked grimly when the play went against them.</p>

<p>Then came a little diversion. They played a
contest against a well-known amateur nine for
charity, and the game was made the occasion for
considerable jollity.</p>

<p>Gregory sent in most of his second string players<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
against the amateurs, but kept Joe as a twirler,
for he wanted him to see what he could do against
some fairly good hitters.</p>

<p>And, to Joe’s delight, he seemed more like his
old self. He had better control of the ball, his
curves “broke” well and he was a source of dismay
to the strong amateurs. Of course Pittston,
even with her substitutes in the game, fairly
walked away from the others, the right-handed
batters occasionally doing left stick-work, on purpose
to strike out.</p>

<p>But the little change seemed to do them all
good, and when the next regular contest came off
Pittston won handily, Joe almost equalling his best
record.</p>

<p>It was at a hotel in Buffington, whither they had
gone to play a series of games with that team, that,
one afternoon, as Joe entered his room, after the
game, he surprised a colored bell boy hurriedly
leaving it.</p>

<p>“Did you want me?” asked the young pitcher.</p>

<p>“No, sah, boss! ’Deed an’ I didn’t want yo’all,”
stammered the dusky youth.</p>

<p>“Then what were you doing in my room?”
asked Joe, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I were jest seein’, boss, if yo’all had plenty
ob ice water. Dat’s whut I was doin’, boss! ’Deed
I was.”</p>

<p>Joe noticed that the boy backed out of the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and held one hand behind him. With a quick motion
the young pitcher whirled the intruder about
and disclosed the fact that the colored lad had
taken one of Joe’s neckties. But, no sooner had
our hero caught sight of it than he burst into a
peal of laughter which seemed to startle the boy
more than a storm of accusation.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what all am de mattah, Massa Matson?”
asked the colored lad, his eyes bulging, and
showing so much white that the rest of his face
seemed a shade or two darker. “What all am de
mattah? Ain’t yo’all put out ’bout me takin’ dish
yeah tie? I didn’t go fo’ to steal it, suh! ’Deed
an’ I didn’t. I were jest sort ob borrowin’ it fo’
to wear at a party I’se gwine t’ attend dis ebenin’.”</p>

<p>“Put out about you!” laughed Joe. “Indeed
I’m not. But don’t say you’re going to borrow
that tie,” and he pointed to the one the lad had
tried unsuccessfully to conceal. It was of very
gaudy hue&mdash;broad stripes and prominent dots.
“Don’t say you were going to borrow it.”</p>

<p>“’Deed an’ dat’s all I were gwine t’ do, Massa
Matson. I didn’t go fo’ t’ take it fo’ keeps. I was
a gwine t’ ask yo’all fo’ de lend ob it, but I thought

up mah mind t’ ’propriate it on mah own lookout,

ice water any time yo’all wants it. I&mdash;I’d laik
mighty much, Massa Matson, t’ buy dish yeah tie
offen yo’all.”</p>

<p>“Buy it!” cried Joe, still laughing, though it
was evident that the colored lad could not understand
why.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, that is, not exactly <em>buy</em> it, ’case I
ain’t got no money, but yo’all needn’t gib me no
tips, suh, fo’ a&mdash;fo’ a long time, an’ I could buy it
dat way. Yes, suh, you needn’t gib me no tips fo’
two weeks. An’ yo’all is so generous, Massa Matson,
dat in two weeks’ time I’d hab dis tie paid fo’.
It’s a mighty pert tie, it suah am!”</p>

<p>He gazed admiringly at it.</p>

<p>“Take it, for the love of mush!” cried Joe.
“I’m glad you have it!”</p>

<p>“Yo’all am glad, Massa Matson?” repeated
the lad, as though he had not heard aright.</p>

<p>“Sure! That tie’s been a nightmare to me ever
since I bought it. I don’t know what possessed
me to buy a cross section of the rainbow in the
shape of a scarf; but I did it in a moment of aberration,
I reckon. Take it away, Sam, and never
let me see it again.”</p>

<p>“Does yo’all really mean dat?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Well, suh, I thanks yo’all fo’ de compliment&mdash;I
suah does. An’ yo’all ain’t vexted wif me?”</p>

<p>“Not at all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“An’&mdash;an’ yo’all won’t stop giving me tips?”</p>

<p>“No, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Golly! Dat’s fine! I suah does thank you,
mightily, suh! Won’t all dem odder coons open
dere eyes when dey sees me sportin’ dis yeah tie!
Yum-yum! I gass so!” and Sam bounced out of
the room before Joe might possibly change his
mind. The colored lad nearly ran into Charlie
Hall, who was coming to have his usual chat with
Joe, and the shortstop, seeing the tie dangling
from the bell boy’s hand, guessed what had happened.</p>

<p>“Was he making free with your things, Joe?”
asked Charlie, when Sam had disappeared around
a corner of the hall.</p>

<p>“Oh, I caught him taking my tie, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did the same thing to one of the boys
on my floor the other day. I gave him a flea in
his ear, too.”</p>

<p>“And I gave Sam the tie,” laughed Joe.</p>

<p>“You <em>gave</em> it to him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that thing has been haunting me. I
never wore it but once and I got disgusted with it.”
Joe failed to state that Mabel had showed a dislike
for the scarf, and that it was her implied
opinion that had turned him against it.</p>

<p>“You see,” the young pitcher went on, “I didn’t
know just which of the fellows to give it to, and
two or three times I’ve left it in my hotel room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
when we traveled on. And every blamed time
some chambermaid would find it, give it to the
clerk, and he’d forward it to me. That monstrosity
of a scarf has been following me all over the
circuit.</p>

<p>“I was getting ready to heave it down some
sewer hole, when I came in to find Sam ‘borrowing’
it. I had to laugh, and I guess he thought I
was crazy. Anyhow he’s got the tie, and I’ve gotten
rid of it. So we’re both satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a good way to look at it. How
are things, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“They might, by a strain, be worse,” answered
Joe, a bit gloomily. The game that day had been
a hard one, and Gregory had used a string of three
pitchers, and had only been able to stop the winning
streak of Buffington. Joe had been taken out
after twirling for a few innings.</p>

<p>“Yes, we didn’t do ourselves very proud,”
agreed Charlie. “And to-morrow we’re likely to
be dumped. Our record won’t stand much of that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it won’t. Charlie, I’ve got to do something!”
burst out Joe.</p>

<p>“What is it? I can’t see but what you’re doing
your best.”</p>

<p>“My hardest, maybe, but not my best. You see
this league pitching is different from a college
game. I didn’t stop to figure out that I’d have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
pitch a deal oftener than when I was at Yale. This
is business&mdash;the other was fun.”</p>

<p>“You’re tired, I guess.”</p>

<p>“That’s it&mdash;I’m played out.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take a vacation; or ask Gregory
not to work you so often?”</p>

<p>“Can’t take any time off, Charlie. I need the
money. As for playing the baby-act&mdash;I couldn’t
do that, either.”</p>

<p>“No, I reckon not. But what are you going to
do?”</p>

<p>“Hanged if I know. But I’ve got to do something
to get back into form. We’re going down.”</p>

<p>“I know it. Has Gregory said anything?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s been awfully decent about it, but I
know he must think a lot. Yes, something’s got
to be done.”</p>

<p>Joe was rather gloomy, nor was Charlie in any
too good spirits. In fact the whole team was in
the “dumps,” and when they lost the next game
they were deeper in than ever.</p>

<p>Some of the papers began running headlines
“Pittston Loses Again!” It was galling.</p>

<p>Jimmie Mack worked hard&mdash;so did Gregory&mdash;and
he, and Trainer McGuire, devised all sorts of
plans to get the team back in form again. But
nothing seemed to answer. The Pittstons dropped
to the rear of the first division, and only clung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
there by desperate work, and by poor playing on
the part of other teams.</p>

<p>In all those bitter, dreary days there were some
bright spots for Joe, and he treasured them greatly.
One was that his father was no worse, though
the matter of the operation was not definitely settled.
Another was that he heard occasionally from
Mabel&mdash;her letters were a source of joy to him.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Old Pop Dutton seemed to be “making
good.” He kept steadily at work, and had begun
to do some real baseball practice. Joe wrote
to him, and his letters were answered promptly.
Even cynical Gregory admitted that perhaps,
after all, the former star pitcher might come into
his own again.</p>

<p>“When will you give him a trial?” asked Joe,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, some day. I’ll put him in the field when
we’re sure of an easy game.”</p>

<p>The time came when the tail-enders of the
league arrived for a series of contests with Pittston,
and Pop Dutton, to his delight, was allowed
to play. There was nothing remarkable about it,
but he made no errors, and once, taking a rather
desperate chance on a long fly, he beat it out and
retired the batter.</p>

<p>He was roundly applauded for this, and it must
have warmed his heart to feel that once more he
was on the road he had left so long before. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
coming back was not easy work. Joe realized this,
and he knew the old pitcher must have had a hard
struggle to keep on the narrow path he had
marked out for himself. But Joe’s influence was a
great help&mdash;Dutton said so often. The other
players, now that they found their former mate
was not bothering them, begging money, or asking
for loans, took more kindly to him. But few believed
he could “come back,” in the full meaning
of the words.</p>

<p>“He may be a fairly good fielder, and his batting
average may beat mine,” said Tooley, “but
he’ll never be the ‘iron man’ he once was.” And
nearly all agreed with him.</p>

<p>Joe was faithful to his protegé. Often the two
would saunter out to some quiet place and there
pitch and catch for each other. And Joe’s trained
eye told him that the other’s hand had lost little
of its former cunning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fortunes of Pittston did not improve
much. Sometimes they would struggle to
second place, only to slip back again, while victorious
Clevefield held her place at the top.</p>

<p>There was only one consolation&mdash;Pittston did
not drop out of the first division. She never got
lower than fourth.</p>

<p>Joe was being used less and less on the pitching
mound, and his heart was sore. He knew he could
make good if only something would happen to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
him back his nerve, or a certain something he
lacked. But he could not understand what.</p>

<p>Properly enough it was Pop Dutton who put
him on the right track. The two were pitching
and catching one day, when Joe delivered what he
had always called a “fade-away” ball, made famous
by Mathewson, of the New York Giants. As
it sailed into Pop’s big mitt the veteran called:</p>

<p>“What was that, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Fade-away, of course.”</p>

<p>“Show me how you hold the ball when you
throw it.”</p>

<p>Joe did so. The old pitcher studied a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>“Joe, you’ve got it wrong. Have you been
pitching that way all the while?”</p>

<p>“Always.”</p>

<p>“No wonder they have been hitting you. Let
me show you something. Stand behind me.”</p>

<p>The old pitcher threw at the fence. Joe was
amazed at the way the ball behaved. It would
have puzzled the best of batters.</p>

<p>“How did you do it?” asked Joe, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“By using a different control, and holding the
ball differently. I’ll show you. You need a new
hold.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>JOE’S TRIUMPH</small></h2>


<p>Then began a lesson, the learning of which
proved of great value to Joe in his after life as a
ball player. If Old Pop Dutton had not the nerve
to “come back” as a pitcher in a big league, at
least he could show a rising young one how to correct
his faults. And a fault Joe certainly had.</p>

<p>For several years he had been throwing the
fade-away ball in the wrong manner. Not entirely
wrong, to be sure, or he never would have attained
the results he had, but it was sufficiently wrong to
prevent him from having perfect control of that
style of ball, and perfect control is the first law of
pitching.</p>

<p>For some time the two practiced, unobserved,
and Joe was glad of this. He felt more hopeful
than at any time since his team had commenced to
“slump.”</p>

<p>“Am I getting there?” Joe anxiously asked of
the veteran, one day.</p>

<p>“Indeed you are, boy! But that’s enough for
to-day. You are using some new muscles in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
arm and hand, and I don’t want you to tire out.
You’ll probably have to pitch to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I only wish I could use this style ball.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be safe yet.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not. But I’m going to keep at
it.”</p>

<p>It was not easy. It is always more difficult to
“unlearn” a wrong way of doing a thing, and start
over again on the right, than it is to learn the
proper way at first. The old method will crop up
most unexpectedly; and this happened in Joe’s case
more times than he liked.</p>

<p>But he persisted and gradually he felt that he
was able to deliver the fade-away as it ought to
come from a pitcher’s hand. Now he waited the
opportunity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile baseball matters were going on in
rather slow fashion. All the teams, after the fierce
rush and enthusiasm of the opening season, had
now begun to fall off. The dog-days were upon
them, and the heat seemed to take all the energy
out of the men.</p>

<p>Still the games went on, with Pittston rising and
falling on the baseball thermometer from fourth
to second place and occasionally remaining stationary
in third. First place was within striking distance
several times, but always something seemed
to happen to keep Joe’s team back.</p>

<p>It was not always poor playing, though occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
it was due to this. Often it was just
fate, luck, or whatever you want to call it. Fielders
would be almost certain of a ball rolling toward
them, then it would strike a stone or a clod of dirt
and roll to one side.</p>

<p>Not much, perhaps, but enough so that the man
would miss the ball, and the runner would be safe,
by a fraction of time or space. It was heart-breaking.</p>

<p>Joe continued to work at the proper fade-away
and he was getting more and more expert in its
use. His control was almost perfect. Still he
hesitated to use it in a game, for he wanted to be
perfect.</p>

<p>A new pitcher&mdash;another south-paw, or left-hander&mdash;was
purchased from another league club,
at a high price, and for a time he made good. Joe
was fearful lest he be given his release, for really
he was not doing as well as he had at first. Truth
to tell he was tired out, and Gregory should have
realized this.</p>

<p>But he did not until one day a sporting writer,
in a sensible article telling of the chances of the
different teams in the Central League for winning
the pennant, wrote of Joe:</p>

<p>“This young pitcher, of whom bright things
were predicted at the opening of the season, has
fallen off woefully. At times he shows brilliant
flashes of form, but it seems to me that he is going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
stale. Gregory should give him a few days off.”</p>

<p>Then the manager “woke up.”</p>

<p>“Joe, is this true?” he asked, showing the youth
the article.</p>

<p>“Well, I am a bit tired, Gregory, but I’m not
asking for a vacation,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>“I know you’re not, but you’re going to get it.
You just take a run home and see your folks.
When you come back I’m going to pitch you in a
series of our hardest games. We go up against
Clevefield again. You take a rest.”</p>

<p>Joe objected, but half-heartedly, and ended by
taking the train for home.</p>

<p>His heart felt lighter the moment he had started,
and when he got to Riverside, and found his
father much improved, Joe was more like himself
than at any time since the opening of the ball season.
His folks were exceedingly glad to see him,
and Joe went about town, renewing old acquaintances,
and being treated as a sort of local lion.</p>

<p>Tom Davis, Joe’s chum, looked at the young
pitcher closely.</p>

<p>“Joe,” he said, “you’re getting thin. Either
you’re in love, or you aren’t making good.”</p>

<p>“Both, I guess,” answered Joe, with a short
laugh. “But I’m going to make good very soon.
You watch the papers.”</p>

<p>Joe rejoined his team with a sparkle in his eye
and a spring in his step that told how much good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the little vacation had done him. He was warmly
welcomed back&mdash;only Collin showing no joy.</p>

<p>Truth to tell Collin had been doing some wonderful
pitching those last few days, and he was
winning games for the team. The advent of Joe
gave him little pleasure, for none knew better than
he on how slim a margin a pitcher works, nor how
easily he may be displaced, not only in the affection
of the public, always fickle, but in the estimation
of the manager.</p>

<p>“Hang him! I wish he’d stayed away!” muttered
Collin. “Now he’s fresh and he may get
my place again. But I’ll find a way to stop him,
if Gregory gives him the preference!”</p>

<p>Joe went back at practice with renewed hope.
He took Gregory and the catchers into his confidence,
and explained about the fade-away. They
were enthusiastic over it.</p>

<p>“Save it for Clevefield,” advised the manager.</p>

<p>The day when Pittston was to play the top-notchers
arrived. There were to be four games
on Pittston’s grounds, and for the first time since
his reformation began, Pop Dutton was allowed to
play in an important contest.</p>

<p>“I’m depending on you,” Gregory warned him.</p>

<p>“And you won’t be disappointed,” was the reply.
Certainly the old player had improved
greatly. His eyes were bright and his skin ruddy
and clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe was a bit nonplussed when Collin was sent
in for the opening game. But he knew Gregory
had his reasons. And perhaps it was wise, for
Collin was always at his best when he could deliver
the first ball, and open the game.</p>

<p>Clevefield was shut out in the first inning, and,
to the howling delight of the crowd of Pittston
sympathizers and “fans,” the home team got a
run.</p>

<p>This gave the players much-needed confidence,
and though the visitors managed to tie the score
in their half of the second inning, Pittston went
right after them, and got two more tallies.</p>

<p>“We’re going to win, Joe!” cried Charlie Hall.
“We’re going to win. Our hoodoo is busted!”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said the young pitcher, wishing he
had a chance to play.</p>

<p>It came sooner than he expected. Collin unexpectedly
“blew up,” and had to be taken out of
the box. Joe was called on, at the proper time,
and walked nervously to the mound. But he knew
he must conquer this feeling and he looked at
Nelson, who was catching. The back-stop smiled,
and signalled for a fade-away, but Joe shook his
head.</p>

<p>He was not quite ready for that ball yet.</p>

<p>By using straight, swift balls, interspersed with
ins and drops, he fooled the batter into striking
out. The next man went out on a pop fly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Joe teased the third man into striking at an elusive
out. Clevefield was retired runless and the ovation
to Pittston grew.</p>

<p>But it was not all to be as easy as this. Joe
found himself in a tight place, and then, with a
catching of his breath, he signalled that he would
use the fade-away.</p>

<p>In it shot&mdash;the batter smiled confidently&mdash;struck&mdash;and
missed. He did it twice before he realized
what was happening, and then when Joe felt sure
that his next fade-away would be hit, he swiftly
changed to an up-shoot that ended the matter.</p>

<p>Clevefield fought hard, and once when Joe was
hit for a long fly, that seemed good for at least
two bases, Pop Dutton was just where he was most
needed, and made a sensational catch.</p>

<p>There was a howl of delight, and Gregory said
to Joe afterward:</p>

<p>“Your man is making good.”</p>

<p>Joe was immensely pleased. And when, a little
later, at a critical point in the game, he struck out
the third man, again using his famous fade-away,
his triumph was heralded in shouts and cries, for
Pittston had won. It was a triumph for Joe in
two ways&mdash;his own personal one, and in the fact
that he had been instrumental in having Pop Dutton
play&mdash;and Pop’s one play, at least that day,
saved a run that would have tied the score.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>A DANGER SIGNAL</small></h2>


<p>“Boys, we’re on the right road again!” exclaimed
the enthusiastic manager at the conclusion
of the game, when the team was in the dressing
room. “Another like this to-morrow, and one
the next day, if it doesn’t rain, and we’ll be near
the top.”</p>

<p>“Say, you don’t want much,” remarked Jimmie
Mack, half sarcastically, but with a laugh. “What
do you think we are anyhow; wonders?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to be if we’re going to bring
home the pennant,” retorted Gregory.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to do it!” declared Joe,
grimly.</p>

<p>Collin went to pieces in more ways than one
that day. Probably his failure in the game, added
to Joe’s triumph, made him reckless, for he went
back to his old habit of gambling, staying up
nearly all night, and was in no condition to report
for the second game of the series.</p>

<p>“He makes me tired!” declared Gregory. “I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
write his release in a minute,” he went on, speaking
to Jimmie Mack, “only I’m up to my neck in
expenses now, and I can’t afford to buy another
pitcher. I need all I’ve got, and Collin is good
when he wants to be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s only his pig-headedness about Joe
that sets him off. But I think we’ve got a great
find in Matson.”</p>

<p>“So do I. There was a time when I was rather
blue about Joe, but he seems to have come back
wonderfully.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jimmie Mack, “that fade-away
of his is a wonder, thanks to Pop Dutton.”</p>

<p>“Pop himself is the greatest wonder of all,”
went on Gregory. “I never believed it possible.
I’ve seen the contrary happen so many times that
I guess I’ve grown skeptical.”</p>

<p>“He and Joe sure do make a queer team,”
commented the assistant manager. “Joe watches
over him like a hen with one chicken.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he has to. A man like Pop who
has been off the right road always finds lots of
temptation ready and waiting to call him back.
But Joe can keep him straight.</p>

<p>“Now come over here. I want to talk to you,
and plan out the rest of the season. We’re in a
bad way, not only financially, but for the sake of
our reputations.”</p>

<p>If Joe could have heard this he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
worried, especially about the financial end. For
he counted very much on his baseball money&mdash;in
fact, his family needed it greatly.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson’s savings were tied up in investments
that had turned out badly, or were likely to,
and his expenses were heavy on account of the
doctor’s and other bills. Joe’s salary was a big
help. He also earned something extra by doing
some newspaper work that was paid for generously.</p>

<p>But Joe counted most on the final games of the
series, which would decide the pennant. These
were always money-makers, and, in addition, the
winning team always played one or more exhibition
games with some big league nine, and these receipts
were large.</p>

<p>“But will we win the pennant?” queried Joe of
himself. “We’ve got to&mdash;if dad is going to have
his operation. We’ve just got to!”</p>

<p>The news from home had been uncertain. At
one time Dr. Birch had decided that an operation
must be performed at once, and then had come a
change when it had to be delayed. But it seemed
certain that, sooner or later, it would have to be
undertaken, if the inventor’s eyesight was to be
saved.</p>

<p>“So you see we’ve just got to win,” said Joe
to Charlie Hall.</p>

<p>“I see,” was the answer. “Well, I’ll do my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
share toward it, old man,” and the two clasped
hands warmly. Joe was liking Charlie more and
more every day. He was more like a college chum
than a mate on a professional team.</p>

<p>But Pittston was not to have a victory in the
second game with Clevefield. The latter sent in
a new pitcher who “played tag,” to use a slang
expression, with Joe and his mates, and they lost
the contest by a four to one score. This in spite
of the fact that Joe did some good work at pitching,
and “Old Pop,” as he was beginning to be
called, knocked a three-bagger. Dutton was one
of those rare birds, a good pitcher and a good
man with the stick. That is, he had been, and
now he was beginning to come back to himself.</p>

<p>There was a shadow of gloom over Pittston
when they lost the second game, after having won
the first against such odds, and there was much
speculation as to how the other two contests would
go.</p>

<p>Gregory revised his batting order for the third
game, and sent in his latest purchase, one of the
south-paws, to do the twirling. But he soon made
a change in pitchers, and called on Tooley, who
also was a left-hander.</p>

<p>“I may need you later, Joe,” he said as he
arranged to send in a “pinch” hitter at a critical
moment. “Don’t think that I’m slighting you,
boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t. I understand.”</p>

<p>“How’s your fade-away?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Good. You’ll probably have to use it.”</p>

<p>And Joe did. He was sent in at the seventh,
when the Clevefield nine was three runs ahead,
and Joe stopped the slump. Then, whether it was
this encouragement, or whether the other team
went to pieces, did not develop, but the game
ended with Pittston a winner by two runs.</p>

<p>The crowd went wild, for there had been a
most unexpected ending, and so sure had some
of the “fans” been that the top-notchers would
come out ahead, that they had started to leave.</p>

<p>But the unexpected happens in baseball as often
as in football, and it did in this case.</p>

<p>Pittston thus had two out of the four games,
and the even break had increased her percentage
to a pleasing point. If they could have taken the
fourth they would have fine hopes of the pennant,
but it was not to be. An even break, though there
was a close finish in the last game, was the best
they could get.</p>

<p>However, this was better than for some time,
and Gregory and his associates were well pleased.</p>

<p>Then came a series of games in the different
league cities, and matters were practically unchanged.
In turn Buffington, Loston and Manhattan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were visited, the Pittston nine doing well,
but nothing remarkable.</p>

<p>Joe seemed firmly established in the place he
most desired, and his fine delivery was increasing
in effectiveness each day. His fade-away remained
a puzzle to many, though some fathomed it and
profited thereby. But Joe did not use it too often.</p>

<p>The secret of good pitching lies in the “cross-fire,”
and in varying the delivery. No pitcher can
continue to send in the same kind of balls in regular
order to each batter. He must study his man
and use his brains.</p>

<p>Joe knew this. He also knew that he was not
alone a pitcher, but a ball player, and that he must
attend to his portion of the diamond. Too many
twirlers forget this, and Joe frequently got in on
sensational plays that earned him almost as much
applause as his box-work did.</p>

<p>Joe was always glad to get back to Pittston to
play games. He was beginning to feel that it was
a sort of “home town,” though he had few friends
there. He made many acquaintances and he was
beginning to build up a reputation for himself.
He was frequently applauded when he came out
to play, and this means much to a baseball man.</p>

<p>Then, too, Joe was always interested in Pop
Dutton. He was so anxious that the former fine
pitcher should have his chance to “come back.”
Often when scouts from bigger leagues than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Central stopped off to more or less secretly watch
the Pittstons play, Joe would have a talk with
them. Sometimes he spoke of Pop, but the scouts
did not seem interested. They pretended that
they had no special object in view, or, if they did,
they hinted that it was some other player than
Dutton.</p>

<p>To whisper a secret I might say that it was Joe
himself who was under observation on many of
these occasions, for his fame was spreading. But
he was a modest youth.</p>

<p>Joe was not inquisitive, but he learned, in a
casual way, that Pop Dutton was seemingly on
the right road to success and prosperity. It was
somewhat of a shock to the young pitcher, then,
one evening, as he was strolling down town in
Pittston, to see his protegé in company with a
shabbily dressed man.</p>

<p>“I hope he hasn’t taken to going with those
tramps again,” mused Joe. “That would be too
bad.”</p>

<p>Resolving to make sure of his suspicions, and,
if necessary, hold out a helping hand, the young
pitcher quickened his pace until he was close behind
the twain.</p>

<p>He could not help but hear part of the conversation.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” he caught, coming from Dutton’s
companion. “What’s the harm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’ll not. You don’t know how hard it is
to refuse, but I&mdash;I can’t&mdash;really I can’t.”</p>

<p>“You mean you won’t?”</p>

<p>“Put it that way if you like.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I do like, an’ I don’t like it! I’ll
say that much. I don’t like it. You’re throwin’
me down, an’ you’re throwin’ the rest of us down.
I don’t like it for a cent!”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that,” replied Dutton, doggedly.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe <em>we</em> can help it, then. You’re
leaving us in the lurch just when we need you most.
Come on, now, be a sport, Pop!”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve been too much of a sport in the past&mdash;that’s
the trouble.”</p>

<p>“So you won’t join us?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Will you come out and tell the boys so? They
maybe won’t believe me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I can’t see any harm in that.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then, they’ll be glad to see you
again.”</p>

<p>Joe wondered what was afoot. It was as
though he saw a danger signal ahead of Pop Dutton.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>VICTORY</small></h2>


<p>Joe hardly knew what to do. He realized that
all his efforts toward getting the old ball player
back on the right road might go for naught if Pop
went off with these loose companions.</p>

<p>And yet would he relish being interfered with
by the young pitcher? Pop was much older than
Joe, but so far he had shown a strong liking for
the younger man, and had, half-humorously, done
his bidding. Indeed Pop was under a deep debt
not only of gratitude to Joe, but there had been a
financial one as well, though most of that was now
paid.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to see him slip back,” mused
Joe, as he walked along in the shadows, taking
care to keep far enough back from the twain. But
Pop never looked around. He seemed engrossed
in his companion.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” Joe asked himself.</p>

<p>He half hoped that some of the other members
of the nine might come along, and accost Pop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
perhaps taking him off with them, as they had
done several times of late. For the old player
was becoming more and more liked&mdash;he was, in
a way, coming into his own again, and he had a
fund of baseball stories to which the younger men
never tired listening.</p>

<p>“If some of them would only come along!”
whispered Joe, but none did.</p>

<p>He kept on following the two until he saw them
go into one of the less disreputable lodging houses
in a poor quarter of the city. It was a house
where, though some respectable workingmen, temporarily
embarrassed, made their homes for a
time, there was more often a rowdy element, consisting
of tramps, and, in some cases, criminals.</p>

<p>At election time it harbored “floaters” and
“repeaters,” and had been the scene of many a
police raid.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he can want by going in
there?” thought Joe. “It’s a good thing Gregory
can’t see him, or he’d sure say my experiment
was a failure. It may be, after all; but I’m not
going to give up yet. Now, shall I go in, and
pretend I happened by casually, or shall I wait
outside?”</p>

<p>Joe debated the two propositions within himself.
The first he soon gave up. He was not in
the habit of going into such places, and the presence
of a well-dressed youth, more or less known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to the public as a member of the Pittston nine,
would excite comment, if nothing else. Besides,
it might arouse suspicion of one sort or another.
Then, too, Pop might guess why Joe had followed
him, and resent it.</p>

<p>“I’ll just have to wait outside,” decided Joe,
“and see what I can do when Pop comes out.”</p>

<p>It was a dreary wait. From time to time Joe
saw men slouch into the place, and occasionally
others shuffled out; but Pop did not come, nor did
his ragged companion appear.</p>

<p>Joe was getting tired, when his attention was
attracted to a detective whom he knew, sauntering
rather aimlessly past on the opposite side of
the street.</p>

<p>“Hello!” thought the young ball player, “I
wonder what’s up?” He eyed the officer closely,
and was surprised, a moment later, to see him
joined by a companion.</p>

<p>“Something sure is in the wind,” decided Joe.
“I’m going to find out.”</p>

<p>He strolled across the highway and accosted
the detective with whom he had a slight acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Matson, the Pittston pitcher!” exclaimed
the officer.</p>

<p>“What’s up, Regan?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much. Do you know Farley, my
side partner? Farley, this is Matson&mdash;Baseball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Joe, they call him. Some nifty little pitcher, too,
let me tell you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” laughed Joe, as he shook hands with
the other detective.</p>

<p>“Why, we’re looking for a certain party,” went
on Regan. “I don’t mind telling you that. We’ll
probably pull that place soon,” and he nodded toward
the lodging house. “Some of the regulars
will be along in a little while,” he added.</p>

<p>“Pull,” I may explain, is police language for
“raid,” or search a certain suspected place.</p>

<p>“Anything big?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much. There’s been some pocket-picking
going on, and a few railroad jobs
pulled off. A lot of baggage belonging to wealthy
folks has been rifled on different lines, all over the
country, and we think we’re on the track of some
of the gang. We’re going to pull the place and
see how many fish we can get in the net.”</p>

<p>Joe did not know what to do. If the place was
to be raided soon it might mean that his friend,
the old pitcher, would be among those arrested.
Joe was sure of his friend’s innocence, but it would
look bad for him, especially after the life he had
led. It might also be discouraging to Pop, and
send him back to his old companions again.</p>

<p>“How long before you’ll make the raid?”
asked Joe.</p>

<p>“In about half an hour, I guess,” replied Regan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
“Why, are you going to stick around and see it?”</p>

<p>“I might. But there’s a friend of mine in
there,” spoke Joe, “and I wouldn’t like him to
get arrested.”</p>

<p>“A friend of yours?” repeated Regan, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Oh, he’s not a hobo, though he once
was, I’m afraid. But he’s reformed. Only to-night,
however, he went out with one of his old
companions. I don’t know what for. But I saw
him go in there, and that’s why I’m here. I’m
waiting for him to come out.”</p>

<p>“Then the sooner he does the better,” observed
Farley, grimly. “It’s a bad place.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Joe, eagerly, “could you
do me a favor, Mr. Regan?”</p>

<p>“Anything in reason, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Could you go in there and warn my friend to
get out. I could easily describe him to you. In
fact, I guess you must know him&mdash;Pop Dutton.”</p>

<p>“Is Old Pop in there?” demanded the officer,
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Joe, “but I’m sure he’s all
right. I don’t believe you want him.”</p>

<p>“No, he’s not on our list,” agreed Regan.
“Well, say, I guess I could do that for you, Joe.
Only one thing, though. If Farley or I happen in
there there may be a scare, and the birds we want
will get away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“How can we do it, then?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>A figure came shuffling up the dark street, and,
at the sight of the two detectives and the young
pitcher, hesitated near a gas lamp.</p>

<p>“Hello! There’s Bulldog!” exclaimed Regan,
but in a low voice. “He’ll do. We’ll send him
in and have him tip Pop off to come out. Bulldog
is on our staff,” he added. “He tips us off to
certain things. Here, Bulldog!” he called, and a
short, squat man shuffled up. His face had a
canine expression, which, Joe surmised, had gained
him his name.</p>

<p>“Slip into Genty’s place, Bulldog,” said Regan
in a low voice, “and tell a certain party to get out
before the bulls come. Do you know Pop Dutton?”</p>

<p>“Sure. He and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that part of it,” interrupted
the detective. “Just do as I tell you, and do it
quietly. You can stay in. You might pick up
something that would help us.”</p>

<p>“What, me stay in there when the place is going
to be pulled, and get pinched? Not on your life!”
and the man turned away.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Regan. “We’ll get you out
all right, same as we always do. You’re too
valuable to us to go to jail for long.”</p>

<p>Then, as Bulldog started for the dark entrance
to the lodging house, Joe realized that he had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
what is called a “stool-pigeon,” a character hated
by all criminals, and not very much respected by
the police whom they serve. A “stool-pigeon”
consorts with criminals, that he may overhear their
plans, and betray them to the police. Often he is
himself a petty criminal. In a sense he does a duty
to the public, making it more easy for the authorities
to arrest wrong-doers&mdash;but no one loves a
“stool-pigeon.” They are the decoy ducks of the
criminal world.</p>

<p>I am making this explanation, and portraying
this scene in Joe Matson’s career, not because it
is pleasant to write about, for it is not. I would
much rather take you out on the clean diamond,
where you could hear the “swat” of the ball.
But as Joe’s efforts to make a new man of the
old pitcher took him into this place I can do no
less than chronicle the events as they happened.
And a little knowledge of the sadder, darker and
unhappy side of life may be of value to boys, in
deterring them from getting into a position where
it would appeal to them&mdash;appeal wrongly, it is
true, but none the less strongly.</p>

<p>The Bulldog had not been in the building more
than a minute before the door opened again, and
Pop Dutton, alone, and looking hastily around,
came out. Joe got in a shadow where he could
not be seen. He did not want his friend humiliated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
now that he had seen him come out victorious.</p>

<p>For the young pitcher could see that Pop was
the same straight and sober self he had been since
getting back on the right road. His association
with his former companions had evidently not
tempted him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad!” exulted Joe.</p>

<p>Pop Dutton looked curiously at the two detectives.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said briefly, as he passed them,
and they knew that he understood. Not for a
long time afterward did the former pitcher know
that to Joe he owed so much. For, though his
intention in going to the rendezvous of the unfortunates
of the under-world was good, still it might
have been misconstrued. Now there was no danger.</p>

<p>Afterward Joe learned that Pop had been
urged by the man he met on the street to take part
in a robbery. The old pitcher refused, but his
false companion tried to lure him back to his old
life, on the plea that only from his own lips would
his associates believe that Pop had reformed. And
Pop made them plainly understand that he had.</p>

<p>Pop Dutton passed on down the street, and,
waiting a little while, Joe followed. He did not
care to see the raid. The young pitcher soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
reached his hotel, and he felt that Pop was safe in
his own boarding house.</p>

<p>The next morning Joe read of the wholesale
arrests in the lodging house, though it was said
that the quarry the detectives most hoped to get
escaped in the confusion.</p>

<p>“Baggage robbers, eh?” mused Joe. “I wonder
if they were the ones who went through Reggie
Varley’s valise? If they could be caught it would
clear me nicely, providing I could prove it was
they.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE TRAMP AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>Baseball again claimed the attention of Joe
and his mates. They were working hard, for the
end of the season was in sight, and the pennant
ownership was not yet decided.</p>

<p>Clevefield was still at the top of the list, but
Pittston was crowding her hard, and was slowly
creeping up. Sometimes this would be the result
of her players’ own good work, and again it would
be because some other team had a streak of bad
luck which automatically put Joe’s team ahead.</p>

<p>The young pitcher was more like himself than
at any time since he had joined the club. He was
really pitching “great” ball, and Gregory did not
hesitate to tell him so. And, more than this, Joe
was doing some good work with the bat. His
average was slowly but steadily mounting.</p>

<p>Joe would never be a great performer in this
line, and none realized it better than himself. No
clubs would be clamoring for his services as a
pinch hitter. On the other hand many a pitcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in the big leagues had not Joe’s batting average,
though of course this might have been because
they were such phenomenal twirlers, and saved
all their abilities for the mound.</p>

<p>Also did Joe pay attention to the bases. He
wished he was a south-paw, at times, or a left-hand
pitcher, for then he could more easily have
thrown to first. But it was too late to change now,
and he made up his mind to be content to work
up his reputation with his good right arm.</p>

<p>But, even with that, he made some surprisingly
good put-outs when runners took chances and got
too long a lead. So that throughout the circuit the
warning began to be whispered:</p>

<p>“Look out for Matson when you’re on first!”</p>

<p>Joe realized that a good pitcher has not only to
play the game from the mound. He must field
his position as well, and the failure of many an
otherwise good pitcher is due to the fact that they
forget this.</p>

<p>Much of Joe’s success, at this time, was due to
the coaching and advice he received from Pop
Dutton. The veteran could instruct if he could
not pitch yet, and Joe profited by his experience.</p>

<p>No reference was made by Joe to the night Pop
had gone to the lodging house, nor did the old
pitcher say anything to his young friend. In fact
he did not know Joe had had any hand in the
matter. Pop Dutton went on his reformed way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
He played the game, when he got a chance, and
was increasingly good at it.</p>

<p>“Joe!” he cried one day, when he had played
a full game, “we’re getting there! I hope I’ll
soon be pitching.”</p>

<p>“So do I!” added Joe, earnestly. True, the
game Pop had played at centre for the full nine
innings was with the near-tailenders of the Central
League, but it showed that the veteran had “come
back” sufficiently to last through the hard work.</p>

<p>“How is your arm?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Not good enough to use on the mound yet,
I’m sorry to say,” was Pop’s answer. “I guess
I’ll have to have that operation, after all. But I
don’t see how I can manage it. I’m trying to pay
back some of my old debts&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that part worry you,” spoke Joe,
quickly. “If things turn out right I may be able
to help you.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve done a lot already, Joe.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do more&mdash;if I can. Just wait until the
close of the season, when we have the pennant.”</p>

<p>What Joe meant was that he would have the
money for an operation on the pitcher’s arm if
the cash was not needed to put Mr. Matson’s
eyes in shape through the attention of a surgeon.</p>

<p>And this matter was still undecided, much to
the worriment of Joe, his mother and sister, to
say nothing of his father. But it is necessary, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
such matters, to proceed slowly, and not to take
any chances.</p>

<p>Joe felt the strain. His regular salary was much
needed at home, and he was saving all he could to
provide for his father’s possible operation. That
cost would not be light.</p>

<p>Then there was Pop Dutton to think of. Joe
wanted very much to see the old player fully on
his feet again. He did not know what to do,
though, should all the money he might get from
the pennant series be required for Mr. Matson.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do the best I can,” thought Joe.
“Maybe if Gregory and the others see how well
Pop is doing they’ll take up a collection and pay
for the operation. It oughtn’t to cost such an
awful lot.”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head in a puzzled way. Really
it was a little too much for him to carry on his
young shoulders, but he had the fire of youth in his
veins, and youth will dare much&mdash;which is as it
should be, perhaps.</p>

<p>Then, too, Joe had to be on edge all the time
in order to pitch winning ball. No pitcher is, or
can be, at top notch all the while. He can hardly
serve in two big games in quick succession, and
yet Joe did this several times, making an enviable
record for himself.</p>

<p>The rivalry between him and Collin grew,
though Joe did nothing to inflame the other’s dislike.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
But Collin was very bitter, and Pop gave
Joe some warning hints.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe he’d do anything under-handed,”
said Joe, not taking it seriously.</p>

<p>“Well, be on the lookout,” advised the veteran.
“I don’t like Collin, and never did.”</p>

<p>There came a series of rainy days, preventing
the playing of games, and everyone fretted. The
players, even Joe, grew stale, though Gregory
tried to keep them in form by sending them off on
little trips when the grounds were too wet even
for practise.</p>

<p>Then came fine bracing weather, and Pittston
began to stride ahead wonderfully. It was now
only a question of whether Joe’s team or Clevefield
would win pennant honors, and, in any event,
there would have to be several games played between
the two nines to decide the matter.</p>

<p>This was due to the fact that the league schedule
called for a certain number of games to be
played by each club with every other club, and
a number of rainy days, and inability to run off
double headers, had caused a congestion.</p>

<p>Pittston kept on playing in good form, and Joe
was doing finely. So much so that on one occasion
when a big league scout was known to be in attendance,
Gregory said in a way that showed he
meant it:</p>

<p>“Joe, they’re going to draft you, sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The larger or major league clubs, those rated
as AA, have, as is well known, the right to select
any player they choose from a minor league, paying,
of course a certain price. Thus the big leagues
are controllers in a way of the players themselves,
for the latter cannot go to any club they choose,
whereas any big league club can pick whom it
chooses from the little or “bush” leagues. If
two or more of the big clubs pick the same player
there is a drawing to decide who gets him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not worrying,” returned Joe, with
a smile.</p>

<p>After a most successful game, in Washburg,
which team had been playing good ball&mdash;the contest
having been won by Pittston&mdash;Joe was walking
across the diamond with Pop Dutton, when the
young pitcher saw approaching them the same
tramp with whom his protegé had entered the
lodging house that night.</p>

<p>“Hello, Pop!” greeted the shabby man. “I
want t’ see you.” He leered familiarly. Pop
Dutton stopped and gazed with half-frightened
eyes at Joe.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>ON THE TRACK</small></h2>


<p>“Well, are you comin’?” demanded the tramp,
as Dutton did not answer. “I said I want to see
you, an’ I’m dead broke! Took all I had t’ git a
seat on th’ bleachers t’ see de bloomin’ game.”</p>

<p>“Well, you saw a good game&mdash;I’ll say that,”
commented the old player, though his voice was
a bit husky. He seemed to be laboring under
some nervous strain.</p>

<p>“Huh! I didn’t come to see th’ game. I want
t’ see you. Are you comin’?”</p>

<p>Pop did not answer at once. About him and
Joe, who still stood at his side, surged the other
players and a section of the crowd. Some of the
members of the team looked curiously at Pop and
the ragged individual who had accosted him. Collin,
the pitcher, sneered openly, and laughed in
Joe’s face.</p>

<p>“Who’s your swell friend?” he asked, nodding
toward the tramp. Joe flushed, but did not
answer.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m waitin’ fer youse,” spoke the tramp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and his tone was surly. “Come on, I ain’t got
all day.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” said Pop, shortly. “I’m not
coming with you, Hogan.”</p>

<p>“You’re not!”</p>

<p>There was the hint of a threat in the husky
tones, and the glance from the blood-shot eyes was
anything but genial.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not coming,” went on Pop, easily.
He seemed to have recovered his nerve now, and
glanced more composedly at Joe.</p>

<p>“Huh! Well, I like that!” sneered the tramp.
“You’re gettin’ mighty high-toned, all of a sudden!
It didn’t used to be this way.”</p>

<p>“I’ve changed&mdash;you might as well know that,
Hogan,” went on Pop. There were not so many
about them now. All the other players had passed
on.</p>

<p>“Well, then, if you won’t come with me, come
across with some coin!” demanded the other. “I
need money.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not get any out of me.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>There was indignant protest in the husky voice.</p>

<p>“I said you’ll not get any out of me.”</p>

<p>“Huh! We’ll see about that. Now look here,
Pop Dutton, either you help me out, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dutton turned to one of the officers who kept
order on the ball field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jim, see that this fellow gets out,” the old
player said, quietly.</p>

<p>“All right, Pop. What you say goes,” was
the reply. “Now then, move on out of here. We
want to clean up for to-morrow’s game,” spoke
the officer shortly to the man whom Pop had addressed
as Hogan.</p>

<p>“Ho! So that’s your game is it&mdash;<em>Mister</em> Dutton,”
and the ragged fellow sneered as he emphasized
the “Mister.”</p>

<p>“If you want to call it a game&mdash;yes,” answered
Dutton, calmly. “I’m done with you and yours.
I’m done with that railroad business. I don’t
want to see you again, and I’m not going to give
you any more money.”</p>

<p>“You’re not!”</p>

<p>“I am not. You’ve bled me enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve bled you enough; have I? I’ve bled
you enough, my fine bird! Well then, you wait!
You’ll see how much more I’ll bleed you! You’ll
sing another tune soon or I’m mistaken. I’ve
bled you enough; eh? Well you listen here! I
ain’t bled you half as much as I’m goin’ to. And
some of the others are goin’ t’ come in on the
game! You wait! That’s all!”</p>

<p>And he uttered a lot of strong expressions that
the ground officer hushed by hustling him off the
field.</p>

<p>Joe took no part in this. He stood quietly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the side of Pop as though to show, by his presence,
that he believed in him, trusted him and would
help him, in spite of this seeming disgrace.</p>

<p>They were alone&mdash;those two. The young and
promising pitcher, and the old and almost broken
down “has-been.” And yet the “has-been” had
won a hard-fought victory.</p>

<p>Pop Dutton glanced curiously at Joe.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked, as if in self-defence.</p>

<p>“What’s the answer?” inquired Joe, trying to
make his tones natural. “Was it a hold-up?”</p>

<p>“Sort of. That’s one of the fellows I used to
trail in with, before you helped me out of the
ditch.”</p>

<p>“Is he a railroad man?” asked Joe. “I
thought he said something about the railroad.”</p>

<p>“He pretends to be,” said Dutton. “But he
isn’t any more. He used to be, I believe; but he
went wrong, just as I did. Just as I might be
now, but for you, Joe.”</p>

<p>His voice broke, and there was a hint of tears
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it!” said Joe, easily. “I didn’t do
anything. But what sort of a fellow is this one,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>The man had been hustled off the grounds by
the officer.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s just a plain tramp, the same as I was.
Only he hasn’t anything to do with the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
any more, except to rob baggage. That’s his
specialty. He hangs around the depots, and opens
valises and such when he gets a chance.”</p>

<p>“He does!” cried Joe, with sudden interest.
“Is he the fellow the detectives wanted to get the
time they raided the Keystone Lodging House?”</p>

<p>Pop Dutton flushed red.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what do you know about that?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I happened to be around there
when the police were getting ready to close in,”
answered Joe, truthfully enough. He did not
want to embarrass his friend by going into details.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Pop, evidently in relief. “Yes, I
think he was one of the gang they wanted to get.
But they didn’t.”</p>

<p>“He’s taking a chance&mdash;coming here now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s let his whiskers grow, and I suppose
he thinks that disguises him. He’s had a hold
over me, Joe, but I’m glad to say he hasn’t any
longer. I won’t go into details, but I will say that
he had me in his power. Now I’m out.”</p>

<p>“So he used to rob travelers’ baggage, did
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he does yet I guess, when he gets the
chance. Jewelry is his specialty. I remember once
he was telling me of a job he did.</p>

<p>“It was at a small station. I forget just where.
Anyhow this fellow&mdash;Hogan is one of his names&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
pretended to be a railroad freight brakeman.
You know they are rather roughly dressed, for
their work is not very clean. Well, he got a
chance to open a certain valise. I remember it
because he said it was such an odd bag.”</p>

<p>Joe felt a queer sensation. It was as though
he had heard this same story years before. Yet
he knew what it meant&mdash;what it was leading to&mdash;as
well as if it had all been printed out.</p>

<p>“Hogan made a good haul, as he called it,”
went on Pop. “He thought he was going to have
a lot of trouble opening the bag when he came
into the station pretending he wanted a drink of
water. It was a foreign-make valise, he said, but
it opened easier than he thought and he got a
watch and a lot of trinkets that ladies like.”</p>

<p>“He did?” asked Joe, and his voice sounded
strange, even to himself.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why, do you know anything about it?”
asked Pop in some surprise.</p>

<p>“I might,” said Joe, trying to speak calmly.
“Would you remember how this bag looked if I
told you?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Was it a yellow one, of a kind of leather that
looked like walrus hide, and did it have two leather
handles, and brass clips in the shape of lions’
heads?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;that’s exactly how Hogan described it,”
said Pop. “But&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And would you remember the name of the
station at which the robbery took place?” asked
Joe. “That is if you heard it?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Was it Fairfield?”</p>

<p>“That’s it! Why, Joe, what does this mean?
How did you know all this? What is Hogan to
you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much, Pop, unless he proves to be
the fellow who took the stuff I was accused of
taking,” answered Joe, trying to speak calmly.
“Do you know where we could find this man
again?”</p>

<p>“You mean Hogan?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m going to tackle him. Of course it’s
only a chance, but I believe it’s a good one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can easily locate him,” said
Pop. “He hasn’t any money to get far away.”</p>

<p>“Then come on!” cried Joe, eagerly. “I
think I’m at last on the track of the man who
took the stuff from Reggie Varley’s valise. Pop,
this means more to me than you can imagine. I
believe I’m going to be cleared at last!”</p>

<p>“Cleared! You cleared? What of?” asked
the old ball player in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said Joe, greatly excited. “Come
on!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>REGGIE’S AUTO</small></h2>


<p>Hardly understanding what was afoot, and not
in the least appreciating Joe’s excitement, Pop
Dutton followed the young pitcher across the
diamond.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked the old
player, as he hurried on after Joe.</p>

<p>“Get into my street togs the first thing. Then
I’m going to try and find that fellow&mdash;Hogan, did
you say his name was?”</p>

<p>“One of ’em, yes. But what do you want of
him?”</p>

<p>“I want him to tell when and where he took
that stuff from the queer valise. And I want to
know if he has any of it left, by any chance, though
I don’t suppose he has. And, in the third place, I
want to make him say that I didn’t take the stuff.”</p>

<p>Pop Dutton drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“You, Joe!” he exclaimed. “You accused?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s a queer story. But I’m beginning
to see the end of it now! Come on!”</p>

<p>They hurried into the dressing rooms. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of the other players had gone, for Joe and Pop
had been delayed out on the diamond talking to
Hogan. Charlie Hall was there, however, and he
looked curiously at Joe.</p>

<p>“Anything the matter?” asked the young shortstop.</p>

<p>“Well, there may be&mdash;soon,” answered his
friend. “I’ll see you later. Tell Gregory that I
may be going out of town for a while, but I’ll
sure be back in time for to-morrow’s game.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Charlie, as he went in to take
a shower bath.</p>

<p>“Now, Pop,” spoke Joe, as he began dressing,
“where can we find this Hogan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, most likely he’ll be down around Kelly’s
place,” naming a sort of lodging-house hang-out
for tramps and men of that class.</p>

<p>“Then down there we’ll go!” decided the
young pitcher. “I’m going to have an interview
with Hogan. If I’d only known he was the one
responsible for the accusation against me I’d have
held on to him while he was talking to you. But
I didn’t realize it until afterward, and then the
officer had put him outside. He was lost in the
crowd. But suppose he isn’t at Kelly’s?”</p>

<p>“Oh, someone there can tell us where to find
him. But it’s a rough place, Joe.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. You don’t mind going there;
do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly. True, a lot of the men
I used to trail in with may be there, but, no matter.
They can’t do any more than gibe me.”</p>

<p>“We could take a detective along,” suggested
Joe.</p>

<p>“No, I think we can do better by ourselves. I
don’t mind. You see after I&mdash;after I went down
and out&mdash;I used to stop around at all the baseball
towns, and in that way I got to know most of
these lodging-house places. This one in Washburg
is about as rough as any.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to know Hogan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just met him on the road. He used to
be a good railroad man, but he went down, and
now he’s no good. He’s a boastful sort, and that’s
how he came to tell me about the valise. But I
never thought you’d be mixed up in it.”</p>

<p>“Of course I can’t be dead certain this is the
same valise that was robbed,” said Joe; “but it’s
worth taking a chance on. I do hope we can find
him.”</p>

<p>But they were doomed to disappointment.
When they reached Kelly’s lodging-house Hogan
had gone, and the best they could learn, in the
sullen replies given by the habitués, was that the
former railroad man had taken to the road again,
and might be almost anywhere.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” exclaimed Pop sympathetically, as
he and Joe came out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” assented the young pitcher, “for I
did want Reggie Varley to know who really
robbed his valise.” Perhaps Joe also wanted a
certain other person to know. But he did not
mention this, so of course I cannot be sure.
“Better luck next time!” exclaimed the young
pitcher as cheerfully as he could.</p>

<p>They endeavored to trace whither Hogan had
gone, but without success. The best they could
ascertain was that he had “hopped a freight,”
for some point west.</p>

<p>Joe did not allow the disappointment to interfere
with his baseball work. In the following games
with Washburg he fitted well into the tight places,
and succeeded, several times, when the score was
close, in being instrumental in pulling the Pittston
team out a winner.</p>

<p>On one occasion the game had gone for nine
innings without a run on either side, and only
scattered hits. Both pitchers&mdash;Joe for Pittston,
and young Carrolton Lloyd for Washburg&mdash;were
striving hard for victory.</p>

<p>The game came to the ending of the ninth, with
Washburg up. By fortunate chance, and by an
error on the part of Charlie Hall, the home team
got two men on bases, and only one out. Then
their manager made a mistake.</p>

<p>Instead of sending in a pinch hitter&mdash;for a hit
was all that was needed to score the winning run,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the manager let the regular batting order be followed,
which brought up the Washburg pitcher.
Lloyd was tired out, and, naturally, was not at his
best. He popped up a little fly, which Joe caught,
and then sending the ball home quickly our hero
caught the man coming in from third, making a
double play, three out and necessitating the scoring
of another zero in the ninth frame for Washburg.</p>

<p>Then came the tenth inning. Perhaps it was his
weariness or the memory of how he had had his
chance and lost it that made Lloyd nervous. Certainly
he went to pieces, and giving one man his
base on balls, allowed Joe to make a hit. Then
came a terrific spell of batting and when it was
over Pittston had four runs.</p>

<p>It was then Joe’s turn to hold the home team
hitless, so that they might not score, and he did,
to the great delight of the crowd.</p>

<p>This one feat brought more fame to Joe than
he imagined. He did not think so much of it
himself, which is often the case with things that
we do. But, in a way, it was the indirect cause of
his being drafted to a big league, later on.</p>

<p>The season was now drawing to a close. The
race for the pennant was strictly between Pittston
and Clevefield, with the chances slightly in favor
of the latter. This was due to the fact that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
were more veteran players in her ranks, and she
had a better string of pitchers.</p>

<p>A week or so more would tell the tale. Pittston
and Clevefield would play off the final games,
the best three out of four, two in one town and
two in the other.</p>

<p>Interest in the coming contests was fast accumulating
and there was every prospect of generous
receipts.</p>

<p>The winners of the pennant would come in for
a large share of the gate receipts, and all of the
players in the two leading teams were counting
much on the money they would receive.</p>

<p>Joe, as you may well guess, planned to use his
in two ways. The major part would go toward
defraying the expenses of his father’s operation.
It had not yet been definitely settled that one
would be performed, but the chances were that
one would have to be undertaken. Then, too,
Joe wanted to finance the cost of getting Dutton’s
arm into shape. A well-known surgeon had been
consulted, and had said that a slight operation on
one of the ligaments would work wonders. It
would be rather costly, however.</p>

<p>“Joe, I’m not going to let you do it,” said Pop,
when this was spoken of.</p>

<p>“You can’t help yourself,” declared Joe. “I
saved your life&mdash;at least I’m not modest when it
comes to that, you see&mdash;and so I have, in a way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the right to say what I shall do to you. Besides,
if we win the pennant it will be due, as much as
anything, to the instruction you gave me. Now
will you be good!”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to,” agreed Pop, laughingly.</p>

<p>Pittston closed all her games with the other
teams, excepting only Clevefield. The pennant
race was between these two clubs. Arrangements
had been made so that the opening game would
be played on the Pittston grounds. Then the
battle-scene would shift to Clevefield, to come
back to Pittston, and bring the final&mdash;should the
fourth game be needed, to Clevefield.</p>

<p>“If we could only win three straight it would
be fine,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“It’s too much to hope,” returned Pop.</p>

<p>It was the day before the first of the pennant
games. The Pittstons had gone out for light
practice on their home grounds, which had been
“groomed” for the occasion. As far as could
be told Pittston looked to be a winner, but there
is nothing more uncertain than baseball.</p>

<p>As Joe and his mates came off the field after
practice there shuffled up to the veteran player a
trampish-looking man. At first Joe thought this
might be Hogan again, but a second look convinced
him otherwise. The man hoarsely whispered
something to the old pitcher.</p>

<p>“He says Hogan and a gang of tramps are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
a sort of camp in Shiller’s Woods,” said Pop,
naming a place that was frequently the abiding
place of “gentlemen of the road.”</p>

<p>“He is?” cried Joe. “Then let’s make a
beeline for there. I’ve just got to get this thing
settled! Are you with me, Pop?”</p>

<p>“I sure am. But how are we going to get out
there? It’s outside the city limits, no car line goes
there, and trains don’t stop.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to have an auto,” decided Joe.
“I’ll see if we can hire one.”</p>

<p>He was on his way to the dressing rooms, when,
happening to glance through the big open gate of
the ball ground he saw a sight that caused him to
exclaim:</p>

<p>“The very thing! It couldn’t be better. I can
kill two birds with one stone. There’s our auto,
and the man in it is the very one I want to convince
of my innocence! That’s Reggie Varley.
I’ll make him take us to Shiller’s Woods! We’ll
catch Hogan there. Come on!”</p>

<p>Never stopping to think of the peculiar coincidence
that had brought Reggie on the scene just
when he was most needed, Joe sprinted for the
panting auto, Pop following wonderingly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>THE TRAMP RENDEZVOUS</small></h2>


<p>“Come on!” cried Joe to Reggie Varley, not
giving that astonished young man a chance to greet
him. “Come on! Got plenty of gas?”</p>

<p>“Gas? Yes, of course. But where? What is
it? Are they after you?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. We’re after <em>them</em>!” laughed Joe.
He could afford to laugh now, for he felt that he
was about to be vindicated.</p>

<p>“But I&mdash;er&mdash;I don’t understand,” spoke Reggie,
slowly. “Where is it you want to go?”</p>

<p>“After the tramp who rifled the valise you
suspected me of opening in that way-station some
time ago,” answered Joe quickly. “We’re after
him to prove I didn’t do it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but my dear Matson&mdash;really now, I don’t
believe you took it. Sis went for me red-hot, you
know, after you told her. She called me all kinds
of a brute for even mentioning it to you, and
really&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused rather helplessly, while Joe, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the situation into his own hands, climbed up beside
Reggie, who was alone in his big car. The
young pitcher motioned for Pop to get into the
tonneau, and the veteran did so, still wondering
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” laughed Joe, more light-hearted
than he had been in many months. “If
you’ll take us to Shiller’s Woods you may see
something that will surprise you.”</p>

<p>“But still I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>Joe explained briefly how Hogan, the railroad
tramp, had boasted of robbing a valise corresponding
to Reggie’s. Hogan was now within five miles
of Pittston, hiding in a tramps’ camp, and if he
was arrested, or caught, he might be made to tell
the truth of the robbery, clear Joe, and possibly
inform Reggie where the watch and jewelry had
been disposed of.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose he has any of it left,” said
Reggie, simply. “There was one bracelet belonging
to sis that I’d like awfully much to get
back.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can try,” answered Joe, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” broke in Pop, “those fellows
can’t dispose of the stuff they take, and then they
hide it. Maybe we can get it back.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope so,” went on Reggie. “And now,
where do you want to go? I’ll take you anywhere
you say, and I’ve got plenty of gas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shiller’s Woods,” returned Joe. “Do you
know where it is, Pop?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve been there&mdash;once or twice.”</p>

<p>“And now,” went on Joe, as he settled back in
the seat, still in his baseball uniform, as was Pop
Dutton, “how did you happen to be here?” and
he looked at Reggie.</p>

<p>“Why, I had to come up in this section on business
for dad, and sis insisted that I bring her
along. So we motored up, and here we are. Sis
is at the Continental.”</p>

<p>“Our hotel!” gasped Joe. “I didn’t see her!”
His heart was beating wildly.</p>

<p>“No, I just left her there,” returned Reggie.
“She is wild to see these final games&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I hope she sees us win,” murmured Joe.</p>

<p>“But about this chase,” went on Reggie. “If
we’re going up against a lot of tramps perhaps
we’d better have a police officer with us.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a bad idea,” agreed Pop. “We
can stop and pick up a railroad detective I know.
They’ll be glad of the chance to raid the tramps,
for they don’t want them hanging around.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” announced Joe, who was still
puzzling over the manner in which things fitted together,
and wondering at the absurdly simple
way in which Reggie had appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>The car sped away from the ball field, purring
on its silent, powerful way. Pop Dutton gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
directions as to the best roads to follow, and a
little distance out of Pittston he called a halt, in
order that a railroad detective might be summoned.</p>

<p>They found one at a small branch freight station,
and this man called a companion, so there
were five who proceeded to the rendezvous of the
tramps in Shiller’s Woods.</p>

<p>It is not a difficult matter to raid the abiding
place of the men, unfortunates if you will, who are
known as “hoboes,” and tramps. They are not
criminals in the usual sense of the term, though
they will descend to petty thievery. Usually they
are “pan-handlers,” beggars and such; though
occasionally a “yegg-man,” or safe-blower, will
throw in his lot with them.</p>

<p>But for the most part the men are low characters,
living as best they can, cooking meager meals
over a camp fire, perhaps raiding hen-roosts or
corn fields, and moving from place to place.</p>

<p>They have no wish to defy police authority, and
usually disappear at the first alarm, to travel on
to the next stopping place. So there was no fear
of any desperate encounter in this raid.</p>

<p>The railroad detectives said as much, and expressed
the belief that they would not even have
to draw their revolvers.</p>

<p>“We’ll be glad of the chance to clean the rascals
out,” said one officer, “for they hang around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
there, and rob freight cars whenever they get the
chance.”</p>

<p>“But we’d like a chance to talk to them&mdash;at
least to this Hogan,” explained Joe. “We want
to find what he did with Mr. Varley’s jewelry.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, the only thing to do is to surround
them, and hold them there until you interview
them,” was the decision. “I guess we can
do it.”</p>

<p>Shiller’s Woods were near the railroad line, in
a lonesome spot, and the outskirts were soon
reached. The auto was left in charge of a switchman
at his shanty near a crossing and the occupants,
consisting of the two detectives, Joe, Pop
and Reggie, proceeded on foot. They all carried
stout cudgels, though the officers had revolvers for
use in emergency.</p>

<p>But they were not needed. Pop Dutton knew
the way well to a little hollow where the tramps
slept and ate. He led the others to it, and so
quietly did they approach that the tramps were
surrounded before they knew it.</p>

<p>Down in a grassy hollow were half a dozen of
them gathered about a fire over which was stewing
some mixture in a tomato can, suspended over
the flame on a stick, by means of a bit of wire.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, boys!” greeted one of the
officers, as he stood up, and looked down on the
men. It was apparent at first glance that Hogan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was one of them. Pop had silently indicated him.</p>

<p>The tramps started up, but seeing that they were
surrounded settled back philosophically. Only
Hogan looked eagerly about for a way of escape.</p>

<p>“It’s no go,” said one of the railroad detectives.
“Just take it easy, and maybe you won’t be so
badly off as you imagine.”</p>

<p>Hogan had been found at last. It developed
that Pop had asked his former “friends of the
road” to keep track of him, and send word when
located. This had been done by the ragged man
who accosted the old player on the diamond that

<small>THE SLOW WATCH</small></h2>


<p>“Well, what do you want?” growled Hogan,
for he seemed to feel that attention was centered
on him.</p>

<p>“Nothing much&mdash;no more than usual, that is,”
said one of the detectives, to whom the story of the
looted valise had been told. “Where did you put
the stuff you got from this gentleman’s bag some
time last Spring?” was the sharp question.</p>

<p>“Whose bag?” Hogan wanted to know, with a
frown.</p>

<p>“Mine!” exclaimed Reggie. “That is, if you’re
the man. It was a yellow bag, with lions’ heads
on the clasps and it contained a Swiss watch, with
a gold face; some jewelry, including a bracelet of
red stones was also taken.”</p>

<p>Hogan started as this catalog was gone over.</p>

<p>“Now look here!” broke in the officer. “These
gentlemen are willing to make some concessions to
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” spoke Hogan, non-committally. He
seemed easier now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. If you’ll own up, and give back what
you’ve got left we’ll call it off, providing you get
out of the State and keep out.”</p>

<p>“An’ s’posin’ I don’t?” he asked, defiantly.</p>

<p>“Then it’s the jug for yours. You’re the one
we want. The rest of you can go&mdash;and keep
away, too,” added the detective, significantly.</p>

<p>The tramps slunk off, glad enough to escape.
Only Hogan remained.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, but now his nerve was gone.
He looked surlily at Pop, and wet his lips nervously.</p>

<p>“Go on,” urged the officer.</p>

<p>“I guess I did get a few things from his bag&mdash;leastwise
it was a satchel like the one he tells
about,” confessed Hogan.</p>

<p>“Then that clears me!” cried Joe, joyfully.</p>

<p>Reggie Varley held out his hand to the young
pitcher.</p>

<p>“It was silly of me ever to have suspected you,”
he said, contritely. “Will you forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” Joe would have forgiven Reggie
almost anything.</p>

<p>“Where’s the stuff now?” asked the chief detective,
sharply.</p>

<p>Hogan laughed.</p>

<p>“Where do you s’pose?” he asked. “Think I
can afford to carry Swiss watches with gold faces,
or ladies’ bracelets? I look like it; don’t I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly he did not, being most disreputable in appearance.</p>

<p>“Did you pawn it?” asked the other officer.</p>

<p>“Yes, and precious little I got out of it. You
can have the tickets if you like. I’ll never redeem
’em,” and he tossed a bunch of pawn tickets over
to Reggie, who caught them wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Are&mdash;er&mdash;are these stubs for the things?”
he asked. “How can I get them back?”</p>

<p>“By paying whatever the pawnbrokers advanced
on the goods,” answered Pop Dutton, who
looked quickly over the tickets. He knew most of
the places where the goods had been disposed of.</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to do that,” went on the young
man. “I’m much obliged to you, my good fellow.”</p>

<p>Hogan laughed again.</p>

<p>“You’re a sport!” he complimented. “Is that
all you want of me?”</p>

<p>The detectives consulted together a moment.
Then one of them asked Joe and his two friends:</p>

<p>“What do you say? There isn’t much to be
gained by arresting him. You’ve got about all you
can out of him. I suppose you might as well let
him go.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” spoke Joe. “All I wanted was
to have my name cleared, and that’s been done.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to have him prosecuted,” spoke
Reggie. “It might bring my sister into unpleasant
prominence, as most of the things were hers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say, my good fellow,” he went on&mdash;he would
persist in being what he thought was English,
“does the ticket for that bracelet happen to be
among these you’ve given me.”</p>

<p>“No, here’s the thing itself&mdash;catch!” exclaimed
Hogan, and he threw something to Joe, who
caught it. It proved to be a quaint wrist-ornament.</p>

<p>The young pitcher slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“It’ll have to be disinfected before she can
wear it,” he said in a low voice to Reggie. “I’ll
give it to her, after I soak it in formaldehyde.”</p>

<p>Reggie nodded&mdash;and smiled. Perhaps he understood
more than Joe thought he did.</p>

<p>“Is that all you want of me?” asked Hogan,
looking uneasily about.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” answered one of the officers.
“But how did you come to get at the valise?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was easy. I spotted it in the depot and
when that chap wasn’t looking,”&mdash;he nodded at
Reggie&mdash;“I just opened it, took out what I
wanted, and slipped out of the station before anyone
saw me. You’d never have gotten me, either,
if I hadn’t been a dub and told him,” and he
scowled at Pop Dutton.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad, for my own sake, that you
did tell,” spoke Joe.</p>

<p>“Now you’d better clear out,” warned the officer,
“and don’t let us find you near the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
tracks again, or it will be the jug for yours.
Vamoose!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Pop Dutton, softly.
“Have you any money, Hogan?”</p>

<p>“Money! No, how should I get money? I
couldn’t pawn that bracelet, or I’d have some
though. They all said it wasn’t worth anything.”</p>

<p>“My sister values it as a keepsake,” explained
Reggie to Joe in a low voice. “She’ll be awfully
glad to get it back.”</p>

<p>“Here,” went on the old pitcher to his former
companion of the highway, and he passed him a
bill. “It’s all I can spare or I’d give you more.”</p>

<p>Hogan was greatly surprised. He stared at the
money half comprehendingly.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;do you mean it?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Pop.</p>

<p>“Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;I’m sorry!” burst out the
tramp, and, making a quick grab for the bill, he
turned aside and was soon lost to sight amid the
trees.</p>

<p>“Hum! That’s a queer go!” commented one
of the officers.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s got some feeling, after all,” said
Joe, softly.</p>

<p>They had accomplished what they set out to do&mdash;proved
the innocence of the young pitcher. And
they had done more, for they were in the way of
recovering most of the stolen stuff. Joe anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
much pleasure in restoring to Mabel her
odd bracelet.</p>

<p>They motored back to the city from the rendezvous
of the tramps, talking over the strange
occurrence. But they took none of the members
of the ball team into their confidence&mdash;Joe and
Pop. They thought the fewer who knew of it the
better.</p>

<p>“And now if I was sure dad would be all
right, and Pop’s arm would get into pitching shape
again, I wouldn’t ask for anything more,” said Joe
to Reggie that night, when he called on the youth
and his sister.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to win the pennant?” asked
Mabel, softly. She had thanked Joe&mdash;and her
brother&mdash;with blushing cheeks for the return of
her keepsake bracelet. But her blushes were not
for her brother.</p>

<p>“The pennant! Of course!” cried Joe. “I
almost forgot about that! And we’re going to
win it!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see every game, too!” exclaimed
Mabel, with brilliant cheeks and eyes.</p>

<p>The first pennant game with Clevefield was a
hard-fought one. Collin took the mound in the
opening of the battle, and for a time all went well.
He made some mistakes, and the heavy batters on
the other side began “finding” him. But he was
well supported by the fielders and basemen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
three innings ran along with the visitors securing
nothing but zero tallies.</p>

<p>Then came a break. A swift ball glanced off
Collin’s glove, and Charlie Hall, the shortstop,
after a magnificent jump, by which he secured the
horsehide, made a wild throw to first. Then began
a slump, and Collin had his share in it.</p>

<p>Joe was called on, but too late to be of any real
service, though he stopped the rout.</p>

<p>Score: Pittston three, Clevefield nine.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to take three straight, or make a
tie so as to get another game&mdash;making five instead
of four,” said Gregory, gloomily that evening.</p>

<p>The next contest would take place in Clevefield
and the teams made a night journey there. Reggie
and his sister went on by auto early the next
day, arriving in time to visit Joe before practice
was called.</p>

<p>“Joe, you’re nervous!” exclaimed Reggie,
when he met the young pitcher, just before lunch.
“You ought to come out in the country for a little
run. I’ll take you in my car. It will do you
good.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do come,” urged Mabel.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Joe. “But I’ll have to be
back soon. No telling which one of us Gregory
will call on to pitch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get you back in time,” promised Reggie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>So Joe, with the permission of Gregory, who
warned him not to be late, started off for an
auto ride.</p>

<p>They went for some distance into the beautiful
country and Joe was beginning to feel in fit condition
to pitch a great game. As they passed
through one small town, Joe looked at the clock
in a jeweler’s window. Then he glanced at his
watch.</p>

<p>“I say!” he cried in dismay. “Either my
watch is slow, or that clock is fast. Why, I haven’t
time enough to get back to play! What time
have you, Reggie?”</p>

<p>“My watch has stopped. But we can ask the
jeweler if his time is right.”</p>

<p>It was, as Joe learned to his dismay. They had
been going by his watch, and now it developed
that it was nearly an hour slow!</p>

<p>“Jove! If I should be late!” cried the young
pitcher in a panic of apprehension.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE RACE</small></h2>


<p>There was but one thing to do&mdash;make all speed
back to the ball park. Already, in fancy, Joe could
see his team trotting out for warming-up practice,
and wondering, perhaps, why he was not there
with them.</p>

<p>“This is fierce!” he gasped. “I had no idea
it was so late!”</p>

<p>“Neither had I,” admitted Reggie. “It was
such easy going that I kept on. It was my fault,
Joe.”</p>

<p>“No, it was my own. I ought to have kept
track of the time on such an important occasion.
Of course I don’t mean to say that they won’t win
the game without me, but if Gregory should happen
to call on me and I wasn’t there it would look
bad. I’m supposed to be there for every game, if
I’m able, whether they use me or not.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll get you there!” cried Reggie. “I’ll
make this old machine hum, take my word for
that! We’ll have a grand old race against time,
Joe!”</p>

<p>“Only don’t get arrested for speeding,” cautioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the young pitcher. “That would be as bad
as not getting there at all.”</p>

<p>He looked at his watch while Reggie turned the
car around in a narrow street, necessitating some
evolutions. Again Joe compared his timepiece
with the clock in the window of the jewelry store.
His watch was more than an hour slow.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” he murmured. “It
never acted like this before.”</p>

<p>Joe’s watch was not a fancy one, nor expensive,
but it had been recommended by a railroad friend,
and could be relied on to keep perfect time. In
fact it always had, and in the several years he had
carried it the mechanism had never varied more
than half a minute.</p>

<p>“Maybe the hair spring is caught up,” suggested
Reggie. “That happens to mine sometimes.”</p>

<p>“That would make it go fast, instead of slow,”
said Joe. “It can’t be that.”</p>

<p>He opened the back case, and looked at the
balance wheel, and the mechanism for regulating
the length of the hair spring, which controls the
time-keeping qualities of a watch.</p>

<p>“Look!” he cried to Reggie, showing him,
“the pointer is shoved away over to one side.
And my watch has been running slow, no telling
for how long. That’s what made us late. My
watch has been losing time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you do it?” asked Reggie.</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“Then it was an accident. You can explain to
your manager how it happened, and he’ll excuse
you.”</p>

<p>“It was no accident!” cried Joe.</p>

<p>“No accident! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that someone did this on purpose!”
cried Joe. “Someone got at my watch when I
wasn’t looking, and shoved the regulator lever
over to slow. That was so it would lose time
gradually, and I wouldn’t notice. It has lost
over an hour. This is too bad!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry,” advised Reggie, as he
speeded the car ahead, turning into a long, country
road that would take them almost directly to the
ball park. “I’ll get you there on time if I have
to do it on bare rims. Let the tires go! But who
do you imagine could have slowed down your
watch?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to say&mdash;not until I have more
proof,” answered Joe, slowly. “It would not be
fair.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not. Yet it was a mean trick,
if it was done on purpose. They didn’t want you
to get back in time to pitch. Say! Could it have
been any of the Clevefield players? They have
plenty of cause to be afraid of you for what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
did in the game yesterday&mdash;after you got a
chance.”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t any of them,” said Joe, with a
shake of his head. “They’re too good sports to
do a thing like that. Besides, I didn’t do so much
to them yesterday. We couldn’t have had a much
worse drubbing.”</p>

<p>“But you prevented it from being a regular
slaughter.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. But it was none of them who slowed
my watch.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it was one of your own
men!” cried Reggie.</p>

<p>“I won’t answer now,” returned Joe, slowly.
“Let’s see if we can get there on time.”</p>

<p>Joe was doing some hard thinking. There was
just one man on the Pittston nine who would have
perpetrated a trick like this, and that man was
Collin. He disliked Joe very much because of his
ability, and since the game of yesterday, when
Collin, unmercifully batted, had been taken out to
let Joe fill his place, there was more cause than
ever for this feeling of hatred&mdash;no good cause, but
sufficient in the eyes of a vindictive man.</p>

<p>Joe realized this. He also realized that Collin
might even throw away the chance for his team
to win in order to gratify a personal grudge.
Other players had said as much to Joe, and it was
almost an open secret that Gregory intended giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Collin his release at the end of the season. But
Joe had not believed his enemy would go to such
lengths.</p>

<p>“He must be afraid I’ll be put in first to-day,”
thought Joe, “and that he won’t get a chance at
all. Jove, what a mean trick!”</p>

<p>Joe had no “swelled head,” and he did not
imagine, for a moment, that he was the best
pitcher in the world. Yet he knew his own abilities,
and he knew he could pitch a fairly good
game, even in a pinch. It was but natural, then,
that he should want to do his best.</p>

<p>For Joe was intensely loyal to the team. He
had always been so, not only since he became a
professional, but while he was at Yale, and when
he played on his school nine.</p>

<p>“Hold on now!” called Reggie, suddenly
breaking in on Joe’s musings. “I’m going to speed
her up!”</p>

<p>The car sprang forward with a jump, and Joe
was jerked sharply back. Then the race was on
in earnest.</p>

<p>The young pitcher quickly made up his mind.
He would say nothing about the slowed watch,
and if he arrived too late to take part in the game&mdash;provided
he had been slated to pitch&mdash;he would
take his medicine. But he resolved to watch Collin
carefully.</p>

<p>“He might betray himself,” Joe reasoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>He could easily see how the trick had been
worked. The players came to the ball field in
their street clothes, and changed to their uniforms
in the dressing rooms under the grandstand. An
officer was always on guard at the entrance, to
admit none but the men supposed to go in. But
Collin could easily have gone to Joe’s locker,
taken out his watch and shoved over the regulator.
It was the work of only a few seconds.</p>

<p>Naturally when one’s watch had been running
correctly one would not stop to look and see if the
regulator was in the right position. One would
take it for granted. And it was only when Joe
compared his timepiece with another that he
noticed the difference.</p>

<p>Could they make it up? It was almost time for
the game to start, and they were still some distance
from the grounds. There was no railroad
or trolley line available, and, even if there had
been, the auto would be preferable.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll do it,” Joe murmured, looking at
his watch, which he had set correctly, also regulating
it as well as he could.</p>

<p>“We’ve just got to!” exclaimed Reggie, advancing
the spark.</p>

<p>They were certainly making good time, and
Reggie was a careful driver. This time he took
chances that he marveled at later. But the spirit
of the race entered into him, and he clenched his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
teeth, held the steering wheel in a desperate grip,
with one foot on the clutch pedal, and the other on
the brake. His hand was ready at any moment
to shoot out and grasp the emergency lever to
bring the car up standing if necessary.</p>

<p>And it might be necessary any moment, for
though the road was good and wide it was well
crowded with other autos, and with horse-drawn
vehicles.</p>

<p>On and on they sped. Now some dog would
run out to bark exasperatingly at the flying machine,
and Reggie, with muttered threats, would
be ready to jam on both brakes in an instant. For
a dog under an auto’s wheels is a dangerous proposition,
not only for the dog but for the autoist as
well.</p>

<p>“Get out, you cur!” yelled Joe, as a yellow
brute rushed from one house. “I wish I had
something to throw at you!”</p>

<p>“Throw your watch!” cried Reggie grimly,
above the noise of the machine.</p>

<p>“No, it’s a good watch yet, in spite of that
trick,” answered Joe. “It wasn’t the fault of the
watch.”</p>

<p>Once more he looked at it. Time was ticking
on, and they still had several miles to go. The
game must have been called by this time, and Joe
was not there. He clenched his hands, and shut
his teeth tightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll do it&mdash;or bust!” declared Reggie.</p>

<p>His car was not a racer, but it was capable of
good speed. He did not dare use all that was
available, on account of the traffic. Many autos
were taking spectators to the game, and they were
in a hurry, too.</p>

<p>Amid dust clouds they sped on, the engine whining
and moaning at the speed at which it was run.
But it ran true and “sweet,” with never a miss.</p>

<p>“They’re playing now!” spoke Joe, in a low
voice. In fancy he could hear the clang of the
starting gong, and hear the umpire cry:</p>

<p>“Play ball!”</p>

<p>And he was not there!</p>

<p>“We’ll do it!” muttered Reggie.</p>

<p>He tried to pass a big red car that, unexpectedly,
swerved to one side. Reggie, in desperation,
as he saw a collision in prospect, whirled the steering
wheel to one side. His car careened and almost
went over. Joe clung to the seat and braced
himself.</p>

<p>An instant later there was a sharp report, and
the car, wobbling from side to side, shot up a
grassy bank at the side of the road.</p>

<p>“A blow-out!” yelled Reggie, and then, as he
managed to bring the car to a sudden stop, the
vehicle settled over on one side, gently enough,
tossing Joe out on the grass with a thud.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>A DIAMOND BATTLE</small></h2>


<p>Confusion reigned supreme for a moment.
Several autos that were passing stopped, and men
and women came running up to be of assistance if
necessary.</p>

<p>But neither Joe nor Reggie was hurt.</p>

<p>Slowly the young pitcher picked himself up, and
gazed about in some bewilderment. For a moment
he could not understand what had happened.
Then he saw Reggie disentangling himself from
the steering wheel.</p>

<p>“Hurt?” asked Joe, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No. Are you?”</p>

<p>“Not a scratch.”</p>

<p>“Rotten luck!” commented Reggie. “Now
you’ll never get to the game on time.”</p>

<p>“Lucky you weren’t both killed,” commented
an elderly autoist. “And your car isn’t damaged
to speak of. Only a tire to the bad. That grassy
bank saved you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Reggie. “All she needs is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
righting, but by the time that’s done it will be too
late.”</p>

<p>“Where were you going?” asked another man.</p>

<p>“To the game,” answered Reggie.</p>

<p>“I’m on the Pittston team,” said Joe. “I’m
supposed to be there to pitch if I’m needed. Only&mdash;I
won’t be there,” he finished grimly.</p>

<p>“Yes you will!” cried a man who had a big
machine. “I’ll take you both&mdash;that is, if you
want to leave your car,” he added to Reggie.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess that will be safe enough. I’ll
notify some garage man to come and get it,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“Then get into my car,” urged the gentleman.
“I’ve got plenty of room&mdash;only my two daughters
with me. They’ll be glad to meet a player&mdash;they’re
crazy about baseball&mdash;we’re going to the game,
in fact. Get in!”</p>

<p>Escorted by the man who had so kindly come to
their assistance, Joe and Reggie got into the big
touring car.</p>

<p>The other autoists who had stopped went on,
one offering to notify a certain garage to come and
get Reggie’s car. Then the young pitcher was
again speeded on his way.</p>

<p>The big car was driven at almost reckless speed,
and when Joe reached the ball park, and fairly
sprang in through the gate, he was an hour late&mdash;the
game was about half over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Without looking at Gregory and the other
players who were on the bench, Joe gave a quick
glance at the score board. It told the story in
mute figures.</p>

<p>It was the start of the fifth inning, and Pittston
was at bat. Unless she had made some runs so
far the tally was six to nothing in favor of Clevefield.
Joe groaned in spirit.</p>

<p>“Any runs?” gasped Joe, as he veered over to
the bench where his mates sat. He was short of
breath, for he had fairly leaped across the field.</p>

<p>“Not a one,” said Gregory, and Joe thought he
spoke sharply. “What’s the matter? Where
have you been?”</p>

<p>Joe gaspingly explained. When he spoke of the
slow watch he looked at Collin sharply. For a
moment the old pitcher tried to look Joe in the
face. Then his eyes fell. It was enough for Joe.</p>

<p>“He did it!” he decided to himself.</p>

<p>“How many out?” was Joe’s next question.</p>

<p>“Only one. We have a chance,” replied Gregory.
“Get into a uniform as fast as you can and
warm up.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to pitch me?”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to. They’ve been knocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Collin out of the box.” Gregory said the last in a
low voice, but he might as well have shouted it for
it was only too well known. Collin himself realized
it. He fairly glared at Joe.</p>

<p>As Joe hurried to the dressing room&mdash;his uniform
fortunately having been left there early that
morning&mdash;he looked at the bases. Bob Newton
was on second, having completed a successful steal
as Joe rushed in. Charlie Hall was at bat, and
Joe heard the umpire drone as he went under the
grandstand:</p>

<p>“Strike two!”</p>

<p>“Our chances are narrowing,” thought Joe, and
a chill seemed to strike him. “If we lose this
game it practically means the loss of the pennant,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But he did not like to think further. He realized
that the money he had counted on would not
be forthcoming.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to admit that we’ll lose,” and
Joe gritted his teeth. “We’re going to win.”</p>

<p>Quickly he changed into his uniform, and while
he was doing it the stand above him fairly shook
with a mighty yell.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s done something!” cried Joe
aloud. “Oh, if I was only there to see!”</p>

<p>The yelling continued, and there was a sound
like thunder as thousands of feet stamped on the
stand above Joe’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it? What is it?” he asked himself,
feverishly, and his hands trembled so that he
could hardly tie the laces of his shoes.</p>

<p>He rushed out to find the applause still continuing
and was just in time to see Charlie Hall
cross the rubber plate.</p>

<p>“He must have made a home run! That means
two, for he brought in Bob!” thought Joe.</p>

<p>He knew this was so, for, a moment later he
caught the frantic shouts:</p>

<p>“Home-run Hall! Home-run Hall!”</p>

<p>“Did you do it, old man?” cried Joe, rushing
up to him.</p>

<p>“Well, I just <em>had</em> to,” was the modest reply.
“I’m not going to let you do all the work on this
team.”</p>

<p>Gregory was clapping the shortstop on the
back.</p>

<p>“Good work!” he said, his eyes sparkling.
“Now, boys, we’ll do ’em! Get busy, Joe. Peters,
you take him off there and warm up with him.”</p>

<p>Charlie had caught a ball just where he wanted
it and had “slammed” it out into the left field
bleachers for a home run. It was a great effort,
and just what was needed at a most needful time.</p>

<p>Then the game went on. Clevefield was not so
confident now. Her pitcher, really a talented
chap, was beginning to be “found.”</p>

<p>Whether it was the advent of Joe, after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
sensational race, or whether the Pittston players
“got onto the Clevefield man’s curves,” as Charlie
Hall expressed it, was not quite clear. Certainly
they began playing better from that moment and
when their half of the fifth closed they had three
runs to their credit. The score was</p>

<p>“We only need four more to win&mdash;if we can
shut them out,” said Gregory, as his men took the
field again. He sat on the bench directing the
game. “Go to it, Joe!”</p>

<p>“I’m going!” declared our hero, grimly.</p>

<p>He realized that he had a hard struggle ahead
of him. Not only must he allow as few hits as
possible, but, with his team-mates, he must help
to gather in four more tallies.</p>

<p>And then the battle of the diamond began in
earnest.</p>

<p>Joe pitched magnificently. The first man up
was a notoriously heavy hitter, and Joe felt
tempted to give him his base on balls. Instead he
nerved himself to strike him out if it could be
done. Working a cross-fire, varying it with his
now famous fade-away ball, Joe managed to get
to two balls and two strikes, both the latter being
foul ones.</p>

<p>He had two more deliveries left, and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
one he sent in with all the force at his command.</p>

<p>The bat met it, and for an instant Joe’s heart
almost stopped a beat. Then he saw the ball sailing
directly into the hands of Charlie Hall. The
man was out.</p>

<p>Joe did not allow a hit that inning. Not a man
got to first, and the last man up was struck out
cleanly, never even fouling the ball.</p>

<p>“That’s the boy!” cried the crowd as Joe came
in. “That’s the boy!”</p>

<p>His face flushed with pleasure. He looked for
Collin, but that player had disappeared.</p>

<p>The rest of that game is history in the Central
League. How Pittston rallied, getting one run in
the sixth, and another in the lucky seventh, has
been told over and over again.</p>

<p>Joe kept up his good work, not allowing a hit
in the sixth. In the seventh he was pounded for a
two-bagger, and then he “tightened up,” and
there were no runs for the Clevefields.</p>

<p>They were fighting desperately, for they saw
the battle slipping away from them. Pittston tied
the score in the eighth and there was pandemonium
in the stands. The crowd went wild with delight.</p>

<p>“Hold yourself in, old man,” Gregory warned
his pitcher. “Don’t let ’em get your goat. They’ll
try to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Joe. He was supremely
happy.</p>

<p>There was almost a calamity in the beginning
of the ninth. Pittston’s first batter&mdash;Gus Harrison&mdash;struck
out, and there was a groan of anguish.
Only one run was needed to win the game, for it
was now evident that the Clevefield batters could
not find Joe.</p>

<p>George Lee came up, and popped a little fly.
The shortstop fumbled it, but stung it over to
first. It seemed that George was safe there, but
the umpire called him out.</p>

<p>“Boys, we’ve got a bare chance left,” said
Gregory. “Go to it.”</p>

<p>And they did. It was not remarkable playing,
for the Clevefields had put in a new pitcher who
lost his nerve. With two out he gave Joe, the
next man, his base. Joe daringly stole to second,
and then Terry Hanson made up for previous bad
work by knocking a three-bagger. Joe came in
with the winning run amid a riot of yells. The
score, at the beginning of the last half of the
ninth:</p>

<p>“Hold ’em down, Joe! Hold ’em down!”
pleaded Gregory.</p>

<p>And Joe did. It was not easy work, for he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
tired and excited from the auto run, and the close
call he had had. But he pitched magnificently, and
Clevefield’s last record at bat was but a single hit.
No runs came in. Pittston had won the second
game of the pennant series by one run. Narrow
margin, but sufficient.</p>

<p>And what rejoicing there was! Joe was the
hero of the hour, but his ovation was shared by
Charlie Hall and the others who had done such
splendid work. Pop Dutton did not play, much
to his regret.</p>

<p>“Congratulations, old man,” said the Clevefield
manager to Gregory. “That’s some little
pitcher you’ve got there.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we think.”</p>

<p>“Is he for sale?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life.”</p>

<p>“Still, I think you’re going to lose him,” went
on Clevefield’s manager.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Gregory in alarm.</p>

<p>The other whispered something.</p>

<p>“Is that so! Scouting here, eh? Well, if they
get Joe in a big league I suppose I ought to be
glad, for his sake. Still, I sure will hate to lose
him. He was handicapped to-day, too,” and he
told of the delay.</p>

<p>“He sure has nerve!” was the well-deserved
compliment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>THE PENNANT</small></h2>


<p>The pennant was not yet won. So far the teams
had broken even, and unless Pittston could take
the next two games there would be a fifth one
necessary.</p>

<p>“If there is,” decided Gregory, “we’ll make it
an exhibition, on some neutral diamond, and get a
big crowd. It will mean a lot more money for
us.”</p>

<p>“Will it?” asked Joe. “Then let’s do it!”</p>

<p>“We can’t make sure of it,” went on the manager.
“We’ll not think of that, for it would
mean throwing a game away if we won the next
one, and I’ve never thrown a game yet, and never
will. No, Joe, we’ll try to win both games
straight, even if it doesn’t mean so much cash.
Now take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” promised Joe.</p>

<p>The next contest would take place at Pittston,
and thither the two teams journeyed that evening.
Before they left Joe spent a pleasant time at the
hotel where Reggie and his sister had rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you coming back to Pittston, or stay here
for the fourth game?” the young pitcher asked.</p>

<p>“We’re going to see you play&mdash;of course!” exclaimed
Mabel. “I wouldn’t miss it for anything.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” laughed Joe, and blushed.
“Did you get your auto all right?” he asked
Reggie.</p>

<p>“Yes. The man brought her in. Not damaged
a bit. Sis and I are going to motor in to-morrow.
But I won’t take a chance in giving you a ride
again&mdash;not so close to the game.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” agreed Joe, laughing.</p>

<p>“Did you find out anything?” Reggie went on.
“About who meddled with your watch?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask any questions. It was too unpleasant
a thing to have come out. But my first
guess was right. And I don’t think that player
will stay around here.”</p>

<p>I may say, in passing, that Collin did not. He
left town that night and was not seen in that part
of the country for some years. He broke his contract,
but Gregory did not much care for that, as
he was about ready to release him anyhow. Joe
told the story to the manager only, and they kept
it a secret between them. It was a mystery to Collin’s
team-mates why he disappeared so strangely,
but few ever heard the real story.</p>

<p>The third game with Clevefield came off before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a record-breaking crowd. It was a great contest,
and was only won for Pittston in the tenth inning,
when Jimmie Mack, the doughty first-baseman,
scored the winning run.</p>

<p>The crowd went wild at that, for it had looked
as though Clevefield would take the game home
with them. But they could not stand against Joe’s
terrific pitching.</p>

<p>This made the pennant series stand two to one
in favor of the Pittston team. Another victory
would clinch the banner for them, but the following
game must take place in Clevefield, and this
fact was rather a disadvantage to Joe’s team.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, do your best,” pleaded Gregory,
as he sat with his men on the bench, making up the
batting order. “We want to win!”</p>

<p>Tom Tooley was to pitch in Joe’s place, for
our hero’s arm really needed a rest.</p>

<p>“I may have to use you anyhow, toward the
end, if we get in a hole, Joe,” said the manager.
“So hold yourself in readiness.”</p>

<p>Much as Joe liked to pitch he was really glad
that he did not have to go in, for he was very
tired. The strain of the season, added to the
responsibility of the final big games, was telling
on him.</p>

<p>The battle opened, and at first it seemed to
favor Pittston. Then her best hitters began to
“slump,” and the game slipped away from them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Clevefield came up strong and though, as a desperate
resort, Joe was sent in, it was too late.
Clevefield won the fourth game by a score of nine
to seven.</p>

<p>“That means a fifth game!” announced Gregory.
“Well, we’ll have a better chance in that!
Oh, for a rain!”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jimmie Mack, as they walked
off the field.</p>

<p>“To give Joe a chance to rest up. He needs
it.”</p>

<p>And the rain came. It lasted for two days, and
a third one had to pass to let the grounds at Washburg
dry up. It had been decided to play off the
tie there, for the diamond was a fine one, and
Washburg was centrally located, insuring a big
attendance.</p>

<p>“We should have arranged this series to be the
best three out of five in the beginning,” said Gregory.
“We’ll know better next time. There’s too
much uncertainty in a three out of four&mdash;it practically
means five games anyhow.”</p>

<p>Reggie and Mabel saw every contest, and announced
their intention of going to Washburg for
the last. At least Mabel did, and Reggie could
do no less than take her.</p>

<p>The rest had done Joe good, though of course
it had also allowed his opponents to recuperate.
Joe felt fit to play the game of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The grandstands were filled&mdash;the bleachers
overflowed&mdash;the band played&mdash;the crowds yelled
and cheered. There was a riot of color&mdash;represented
by ladies’ hats and dresses; there was a
forest of darkness&mdash;represented by the more sober
clothes of the men. It was the day of the final
game.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire, and Joe went
to the mound, for Pittston had been lucky in the
toss-up and could bat last.</p>

<p>Joe hardly knew whether he was more elated
over his own chance of shining in this deciding
game or over the fact that Pop Dutton was playing.
The old pitcher had improved wonderfully,
and Gregory said, was almost “big league stuff”
again. So he had been put in centre field. His
batting, too, was a bulwark for Pittston.</p>

<p>Just before the game Joe had received a letter
from home, telling him news that disconcerted him
a little. It was to the effect that an operation
would be necessary to restore his father’s sight.
It was almost certain to be successful, however,
for a noted surgeon, who had saved many by his
skill, would perform it. But the cost would be
heavy.</p>

<p>“So I’ve just got to win this game; to make my
share of the money bigger,” Joe murmured. “I’ll
need every cent of it for dad&mdash;and Pop.”</p>

<p>The winner of the pennant, naturally, would receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the larger share of the gate money, and each
man on the winning team, the manager had promised,
was to have his proportion.</p>

<p>“We’ve just got to win!” repeated Joe.</p>

<p>It was a desperately fought battle from the very
start. Joe found himself a trifle nervous at first,
but he pulled himself together and then began
such a pitching battle as is seldom seen.</p>

<p>For five innings the game went on without a hit,
a run or an error on either side. It was almost
machine-perfect baseball, and it was a question of
which pitcher would break first. Joe faced batter
after batter with the coolness of a veteran. Little
“no count” flies were all he was hit for, not a man
getting to first.</p>

<p>There came a break in the sixth. How it happened
Joe never knew, but he hit the batter, who
went to first, and a runner had to be substituted
for him. Naturally this made Joe nervous and he
was not himself. Then one of the Clevefield players
knocked a home run, bringing in the man from
first, and there were two runs against none for
Pittston, and only one man out.</p>

<p>Then, if ever, was a crucial moment for Joe.
Many young pitchers would have gone to pieces
under the strain, but by a supreme effort, Joe got
back his nerve. The crowd, always ready to be
unfriendly when it sees a pitcher wavering, hooted
and howled. Joe only smiled&mdash;and struck out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the next man&mdash;and the next. He had stopped a
winning streak in the nick of time.</p>

<p>“Get some runs, boys! Get some runs!” pleaded
Gregory, and his men got them. They got
three, enough to put them one ahead, and then Joe
knew he must work hard to hold the narrow margin
so hardly won.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to do it! I’ve just got to do it!” he
told himself. “I want to win this game so I’ll
have money enough for dad&mdash;and Pop! I’m going
to do it!”</p>

<p>And do it he did. How he did it is history now,
but it is history that will never be forgotten in
the towns of that league. For Joe did not allow
another hit that game. He worked himself to the
limit, facing veteran batters with a smile of confidence,
sending in a deadly cross-fire with his
famous fade-away until the last tally was told, and
the score stood:</p>

<p>When the last batter had gone down to defeat
in the first half of the ninth Joe drew off his glove,
and, oblivious to the plaudits of the crowd and his
own mates, hurried to the dressing rooms.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” cried Charlie Hall.
“They’re howling for you. They want to see you&mdash;hear
you talk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe could hear the voices screaming:</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech! Speech, Matson! Baseball
Joe!”</p>

<p>“I just can’t! I’m all in, Charlie. Tell them,”
pleaded Joe. “I want to send a telegram home,
telling the folks that I’ll be with them when dad’s
operated on. I can’t make a speech!”</p>

<p>Charlie told the crowd, and Joe was cheered
louder than before.</p>

<p>And so ended the race for the pennant of the
Central League, with Pittston the winner.</p>

<p>As Joe walked off the field, on his way to the
telegraph office, being cheered again and again,
while he made his way through the crowd, a keen-faced
man looked critically at him.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re going to be mine,” he said. “I
think we’ll have to draft you.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Pop Dutton, who recognized
the man as a well-known scout, on the lookout
for promising players.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” answered the keen-faced one,
with a laugh. Pop laughed also, but it was a laugh
of understanding.</p>

<p>And what it meant&mdash;and what the man’s remark
meant to Joe, may be learned by reading the
next volume of this series, to be called: “Baseball
Joe in the Big League; Or, a Young Pitcher’s
Hardest Struggles.”</p>

<p>Joe hurried home that night, stopping only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
say good-bye to Mabel, and promising to come
and see her as soon as he could. The operation on
Mr. Matson was highly successful. It cost a large
sum, and as his father had no money to pay for it,
Joe used much of the extra cash that came to him
as his share in the pennant series. Had his team
not won he would hardly have had enough.</p>

<p>But there was enough to spare for the simple
operation on Pop Dutton’s arm.</p>

<p>“Joe, I hate to have you spend your money this
way&mdash;on me,” objected the grizzled veteran of
many diamonds. “It doesn’t seem right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, play ball!” cried Joe, gaily. “You can
pay me back, if you want to, you old duffer, when
you get into a bigger league than the Central, and
are earning a good salary.”</p>

<p>“I will!” cried Pop, enthusiastically. “For I
know I’m good for some years yet. I have ‘come
back,’ thanks to you, Joe.”</p>

<p>They clasped hands silently&mdash;the young pitcher
at the start of his brilliant career, and the old one,
whose day was almost done.</p>

<p>Pop’s operation was successful, and he went
South for the Winter, there, in company with an
old friend, to gradually work up into his old form.
Hogan seemed to have vanished, but Reggie got
all the pawned jewelry back. The Pittston players,
in common with the others in the league teams,
went their several ways to their Winter occupations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
there to remain until Spring should again
make green the grass of the diamond.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe!” exclaimed Mrs. Matson, with
trembling voice, when it was certain her husband
would see again, “how much we owe to you, my
son.”</p>

<p>“You owe more to baseball,” laughed Joe.</p>

<p>Clara came in with a letter.</p>

<p>“This is for you, Joe,” she said, adding mischievously:</p>

<p>“It seems to be from a girl, and it’s postmarked
Goldsboro, North Carolina. Who do you know
down there?”</p>

<p>“Give me that letter, Sis!” cried Joe, blushing.</p>

<p>And while he is perusing the missive, the writer
of which you can possibly name, we will, for a
time, take leave of Baseball Joe.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Bomba lived far back in the jungles of the
Amazon with a half-demented naturalist
who told the lad nothing of his past. The
jungle boy was a lover of birds, and hunted
animals with a bow and arrow and his trusty
machete. He had a primitive education in
some things, and his daring adventures will
be followed with breathless interest by thousands.</i></p>
